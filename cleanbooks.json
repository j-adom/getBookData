Written almost a century ago, Ferris challenges societal norms in the fields of history, theology, philosophy as it pertains to Black people and those of African descent. Considered as one of the founding fathers of African studies, Ferris expounds on the history of familiar and not so familiar great Black men around the globe as well as the African ancestry of great historical figures such as Aesop, Hannibal Barca, Russian author Alexander Pushkin, and even founding father Alexander Hamilton. In Volume One, Ferris explores theology, particularly the idea of God's personification as man himself; Black leadership, particularly regarding the strengths and shortcomings of W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington; and Black identity in America. He concludes Volume One with a foray into African history and the African presence in ancient civilizations throughout the world.","price":29.95,"pageCount":572,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781935721666-L.jpg","categories":["African Americans"]}

Rockefeller, and Thomas Edison. While Oprah Winfrey, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Michael Jordan, and Will Smith are among the estimated 35,000 black millionaires in the nation today, these famous celebrities were not the first blacks to reach the storied one percent. Between the years of 1830 and 1927, as the last generation of blacks born into slavery was reaching maturity, a small group of smart, tenacious, and daring men and women broke new ground to attain the highest levels of financial success. Black Fortunes is an intriguing look at these remarkable individuals, including Napoleon Bonaparte Drew—author Shomari Wills’ great-great-great-grandfather—the first black man in Powhatan County (contemporary Richmond) to own property in post-Civil War Virginia. His achievements were matched by five other unknown black entrepreneurs including: Mary Ellen Pleasant, who used her Gold Rush wealth to further the cause of abolitionist John Brown; Robert Reed Church, who became the largest landowner in Tennessee; Hannah Elias, the mistress of a New York City millionaire, who used the land her lover gave her to build an empire in Harlem; Orphan and self-taught chemist Annie Turnbo-Malone, who developed the first national brand of hair care products; Madam C. J Walker, Turnbo-Malone’s employee who would earn the nickname America’s \"first female black millionaire;\" Mississippi school teacher O. W. Gurley, who developed a piece of Tulsa, Oklahoma, into a \"town\" for wealthy black professionals and craftsmen\" that would become known as \"the Black Wall Street.\" A fresh, little-known chapter in the nation’s story—A blend of Hidden Figures, Titan, and The Tycoons—Black Fortunes illuminates the birth of the black business titan and the emergence of the black marketplace in America as never before.","price":26.99,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780062437594-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Believed to be the tomb of an Egyptian king, even though no remains have ever been found, its construction date of roughly 2550 BCE is tied to only one piece of evidence: the crudely painted marks within the pyramid’s hidden chambers that refer to the 4th Dynasty king Khufu, discovered in 1837 by Colonel Howard Vyse and his team. Using evidence from the time of the discovery of these “quarry marks”--including surveys, facsimile drawings and Vyse’s private field notes--along with high definition photos of the actual marks, Scott Creighton reveals how and why the marks were faked. He investigates the anomalous and contradictory orthography of the quarry marks through more than 75 photos and illustrations, showing how they radically depart from the established canon of quarry marks from this period. He explains how the orientation of the Khufu cartouche contradicts ancient Egyptian writing convention and how one of the signs is from a later period. Analyzing Vyse’s private diary, he reveals Vyse’s forgery instructions to his two assistants, Raven and Hill, and what the anachronistic sign should have been. He examines recent chemical analysis of the marks along with the eye-witness testimony of Humphries Brewer, who worked with Vyse at Giza in 1837 and saw forgery take place. Exploring Vyse’s background, including his electoral fraud to become a member of the British Parliament, he explains why he was driven to perpetrate a fraud inside the Great Pyramid. Proving Zecharia Sitchin’s claim that the quarry marks are forgeries and removing the only physical evidence that dates the Great Pyramid’s construction to the reign of Khufu, Creighton’s study strikes down one of the most fundamental assertions of orthodox Egyptologists and reopens long-standing questions about the Great Pyramid’s true age, who really built it, and why.","price":16,"pageCount":224,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591437895-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

During the Civil War, she worked as a nurse for wounded soldiers, a caretaker of refugee slaves, and a spy and scout for Union forces. Late in life she was active in the fight for women's suffrage. Mythologized by many biographers and historians, Tubman was an ordinary but complex woman - tiny but strong, guided by her belief in God and religious visions, yet a tough, savvy leader who the radical abolitionist John Brown admired as \"the General.\" In 2016, it was announced that Tubman would become the first woman to appear on US currency \"the $20 bill\" in over a century. Drawing on the latest historical research, Harriet Tubman For Beginners portrays a woman who resisted and transcended slavery and fought injustice her entire life. Beyond legend, she made her mark on history by defending core American principles - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - for others.","price":15.95,"pageCount":176,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781939994721-L.jpg","categories":["African American abolitionists"]}

Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois When the first Masonic lodges opened in Paris in the early 18th century their membership included traders, merchants, musketeers, clergymen, and women--both white and black. This was not the case in the United States where black Freemasons were not eligible for membership in existing lodges. For this reason the first official charter for an exclusively black lodge--the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts--was granted by the Grand Lodge of England rather than any American chapter. Through privileged access to archives kept by Grand Lodges, Masonic libraries, and museums in both the United States and Europe, respected Freemasonry historian Cécile Révauger traces the history of black Freemasonry from Boston and Philadelphia in the late 1700s through the Abolition Movement and the Civil War to the genesis of the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1900s up through the 1960s. She opens with a look at Prince Hall, legendary founder and the chosen namesake when black American lodges changed from “African Lodges” to “Prince Hall Lodges” in the early 1800s. She reveals how the Masonic principles of mutual aid and charity were more heavily emphasized in the black lodges and especially during the reconstruction period following the Civil War. She explores the origins of the Civil Rights Movement within black Freemasonry and the roles played by Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP, among others. Looking at the deep connections between jazz and Freemasonry, the author reveals how many of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century were also Masons, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Eubie Blake, Cab Calloway, and Paul Robeson. Unveiling the deeply social role at the heart of black Freemasonry, Révauger shows how the black lodges were instrumental in helping American blacks transcend the horrors of slavery and prejudice, achieve higher social status, and create their own solid spiritually based social structure, which in some cities arose prior to the establishment of black churches.","price":29.95,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781620554876-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

In severe cases, there is an addiction to suffering. Frequently, my first attempt at offering suffering individuals another way of seeing their experience is met with fierce resistance, which I call \"the fight to be right.\" Often people unwittingly fight to maintain ownership of the very limitations that cause their suffering. Unfortunately, while fighting for their limitations, most fail to realize this is not a fight they want to win. Rather than engage them in a mental or emotional sparring match, I ask one simple question: \"What is your prayer?\" When an individual seriously contemplates this question, stories about how pain and suffering should or can be tolerated begin to recede. The ego has very few arguments that can survive the power of an earnest and heartfelt prayer.","price":24,"pageCount":360,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781401944018-L.jpg","categories":["Affirmations"]}

Kendi"],"publisher":"One World/Ballantine","publishedDate":"2019","description":"From the National Book Award-winning author of Stamped from the Beginning comes a bracingly original approach to understanding and uprooting racism and inequality in our society--and in ourselves. \"The only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it--and then dismantle it.\" Ibram X. Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America--but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi asks us to think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an active role in building it. In this book, Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. How to Be an Antiracist is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a truly just and equitable society. Advance praise for How to Be an Antiracist \"This latest from the National Book Award-winning author is no guidebook to getting woke. . . . Rather, it is a combination of memoir and extension of . . . Kendi's towering Stamped From the Beginning that leads readers through a taxonomy of racist thought to anti-racist action. . . . Never wavering . . . Kendi methodically examines racism through numerous lenses: power, biology, ethnicity, body, culture, and so forth. . . . If Kendi is justifiably hard on America, he's just as hard on himself. . . . This unsparing honesty helps readers, both white and people of color, navigate this difficult intellectual territory. Not an easy read but an essential one.\"--Kirkus Reviews (starred review) \"Ibram Kendi is today's visionary in the enduring struggle for racial justice. In this personal and revelatory new work, he yet again holds up a transformative lens, challenging both mainstream and antiracist orthodoxy. He illuminates the foundations of racism in revolutionary new ways, and I am consistently challenged and inspired by his analysis. How to Be an Antiracist offers us a necessary and critical way forward.\"--Robin DiAngelo, New York Times bestselling author of White Fragility","price":27,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780525509288-L.jpg","categories":["HISTORY"]}

L. Hughley confronts and remixes white people’s “advice” in this “satirical but apt addition to the culture’s fraught conversation about race” (New York Times Book Review) In America, a black man is three times more likely to be killed in encounters with police than a white guy. If only he had complied with the cop, he might be alive today, pundits say in the aftermath of the latest shooting of an unarmed black man. Or, Maybe he shouldn’t have worn that hoodie … or, moved more slowly … not been out so late … Wait, why are black people allowed to drive, anyway? This isn’t a new phenomenon. White people have been giving “advice” to black folks for as long as anyone can remember, telling them how to pick cotton, where to sit on a bus, what neighborhood to live in, when they can vote, and how to wear our pants. Despite centuries of whites’ advice, it seems black people still aren’t listening, and the results are tragic. Now, at last, activist, comedian, and New York Times bestselling author D. L. Hughley offers How Not to Get Shot, an illustrated how-to guide for black people, full of insight from white people, translated by one of the funniest black dudes on the planet. In these pages you will learn how to act, dress, speak, walk, and drive in the safest manner possible. You also will finally understand the white mind. It is a book that can save lives. Or at least laugh through the pain. Black people: Are you ready to not get shot! White people: Do you want to learn how to help the cause?

{"isbn":9781463507503,"title":"The How to Eat to Live Holistic Companion","author":["Nasir Hakim","Rose Hakim"],"publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publishedDate":"2011-05-27","description":"How To Eat To Live, Books 1 & 2, were first published in 1967 and 1972 respectively. In these books Elijah Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, pointed out very clearly and decisively that it all is from Allah (God) in person. He believes he met God in the form of a man and it is He who revealed the BEST knowledge of how to eat to live. We make no attempt at reinterpreting, reinventing or improving upon what the Messenger received from God. The objective of this book is only to make the reader aware of the means and ways the food and their by-products have been adversely transformed from the initial published dates of these writings to date, and from this awareness and updated information contained herein, can stay consistent with the principles taught in these writings.We felt there was a great need for an essential companion; essential, because through processing and commercialization, food has taken on a different form from what we had grown accustomed to. Since the 60's and 70's, food that was once called “pure” is not pure. Various government agencies responsible for checking the safety of food have adopted various definitions for political and economic reasons, but at the expense of health. Consequently, the word pure simply means that there are “acceptable” levels of toxins, or acceptable levels of mercury, or acceptable levels of pesticides, herbicides or solvents per part, per million.There was a time when brown sugar was a lot healthier than sugar is today. What was once stated as brown sugar was simply “raw sugar.” It was a lot healthier and when Elijah Muhammad recommended it, he did not mean what today has come to be known as brown sugar, which is highly refined white sugar with molasses poured over it. For on one hand he would not advise us to NOT eat refined products while simultaneously telling us to eat the new form of brown sugar.As well, take for instance the aspect of pork. This so-called food is completely prohibited due to forbidding of God and the indestructible worm inside. It is never to be taken for food, so much so, Elijah Muhammad advises that we should die first before we eat it. In today's market, there are hundreds of thousands of products that are made from pork and its by-products. Since the 60's, these products are not so well pointed out. These are just a few of the reasons this book is essential and will serve as an excellent companion to How To Eat To Live, Books 1 & 2.There are two main veins this book will pursue: one is the processes of food and the surrounding equipment associated and secondly, the commercialization of it for maximum profits and the expense of the people's health in general. Of course, secondary to this is the fact that bad food equals bad health, which equals a great economic boom in medicine, doctors and hospitalization. Not only will this book enlightened as to the problems, but it will also furnish solutions in the form of alternatives.We trust the reader will find great benefit in this essential companion.","price":18.95,"pageCount":280,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781463507503-L.jpg","categories":["Health & Fitness"]}

Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status - much like their grandparents before them. In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community - and all of us - to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.","price":27.95,"pageCount":290,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781595581037-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

This is the first book to make this ancient knowledge available to the West. The foundation of healing love is the cultivation, transformation, and circulation of sexual energy, known as jing. Jing energy is creative, generative energy that is vital for the development of chi (vital life-force energy) and shen (spiritual energy), which enables higher practices of spiritual development. Jing is produced in the sexual organs, and it is energy women lose continually through menstruation and child bearing. Mantak Chia teaches powerful techniques developed by Taoist masters for the conservation of jing and how it is used to revitalize women's physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Among the many benefits conferred by these practices are a reduction in the discomfort caused by menstruation and the ability to attain full-body orgasm.","price":16.95,"pageCount":288,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594770685-L.jpg","categories":["Health & Fitness"]}

Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been. In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free. A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.","price":26,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781501125652-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

This is the story of the men, women, and children who toiled in the hot sun picking cotton for their masters; it's about the America ripped in two by Jim Crow laws; it's about the brothers and sisters of all colors who rallied against those who would dare bar a child from an education. It's a story of discrimination and broken promises, determination, and triumphs. Told through the unique point of view and intimate voice of a one-hundred-year-old African-American female narrator, this inspiring book demonstrates that in gaining their freedom and equal rights, African Americans helped our country achieve its promise of liberty and justice—the true heart and soul of our nation.

Prior to that time, most of the Eastern energy practices transmitted to the West were incomplete, dealing only with the ascending yang/masculine channel, which shoots life-force energy up the spine. The Microcosmic Orbit showed practitioners how to establish the descending yin/feminine channel of the life-force energy loop. Within Taoist systems, cultivating feminine energy has always been seen as the key to gaining balance and wholeness. Healing Light of the Tao presents the more advanced methods of chi cultivation in the Microcosmic Orbit, offering a full understanding of Taoist spiritual theory through its comprehensive overview of the complete Taoist body/mind/spirit system. The book also includes more advanced meditation methods for absorbing the higher frequencies of Earth Force, Cosmic Force, and Universal Force (Heavenly chi) into the basic orbit. It establishes a spiritual science that not only emphasizes practical benefits to health, sexual vitality, and emotional balance, but also shows how changes made in the energy body can lead to physical rejuvenation that the Taoists called immortality.","price":26.95,"pageCount":608,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594771132-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

{"isbn":9780997157918,"title":"Hebrews to Negroes 2: Volume 2 Wake Up Black America","author":["Ronald Dalton Jr"],"publisher":"G Publishing","publishedDate":"2016-06-10","description":"\"From beyond the Rivers of Ethiopia My worshippers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings.\" - Zephaniah 3:10 Modern Jewry has been looking for the \"10 Lost Tribes of Israel\" in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Arabia, and India but they never seem to look in Africa. The Ethiopian Jews and the Lemba Jews have been recognized by modern Jewry as having a connection to Ancient Israel but other African countries are often overlooked. Why is this? Jews today now boast to have \"Israelite\" heritage based on the \"Cohen Model Haplogroup\" genetic marker that they say links them to the High Priest Cohenite clan of Aaron, the brother of Moses. But what exactly is this \"Cohen Model Haplogroup\"? Who else in the world has it and is it really an \"Israelite Genetic Marker\" as they claim? In the Book, \"Hebrews to Negroes 2: Volume 2, I dive in deep into the \"world of genetics\" to debunk the lies that has been spread about who we call \"Jews\" or the \"Chosen People\" today. Using Linguistics, Ancient written records from Arab historians, Craniometry, Tooth records, Ancient maps, Ancient archaeological relics, Ancient pictures, the Bible, Genetics and \"Critical Thinking\" one can find out the TRUTH about who the REAL ISRAELITES of the Bible are. It will tell us where we should be looking in regards to finding the \"authentic\" scattered \"Children of Israel,\" not \"outsiders\" who have invaded Judea for the last 2,000 years and decided to convert to Judaism. In this Book many clues to our \"many\" questions about the Bible will be answered and explored. Such as: Who are the descendants of the Ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Cushites and Phuttites today? Who are the \"Original Arabs\" and where are they at today? What is the connection between the Lemba Jews, African-Americans, Caribbean Blacks, Afro-Latinos and \"Bantus\" West/East Africans? Who are the indigenous Native Amerindians? Are they descendants of Ham, Shem or Japheth? Are the Native Amerindians Israelites? Do Latinos have any \"Israelite\" heritage? Where did the 10 Lost Tribes of Northern Israel (Samaria) go after they were exiled in 700 B.C. and is there any DNA proof of this? Who were the Jews that were exiled from Spain and Portugal in 1492 A.D.' Were they \"Black Jews\" or \"White Jews\"? Who are the Sephardic Jews and are they \"imposters\" as well? Who were the Moors? Were they mixed with \"Israelite Blood\"? Can we trace the migration pattern of the Edomites? If so, where are the Edomites today and what nations of people can we find the \"bloodline\" of Edom in? How do we know that the Ashkenazi Jew, the Sephardic Jew and the Mizrahi Jew today are \"Gentiles\" and not \"Jews\"? Are there any Israelites in Asia or the Middle East? A LIE CANNOT LIVE FOREVER!

{"isbn":9780822348030,"title":"Blacks and Blackness in Central America","author":["Lowell Gudmundson","Justin Wolfe"],"publisher":"Duke University Press Books","publishedDate":"2010-10-18","description":"Many of the earliest Africans to arrive in the Americas came to Central America with Spanish colonists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and people of African descent constituted the majority of nonindigenous populations in the region long thereafter. Yet in the development of national identities and historical consciousness, Central American nations have often countenanced widespread practices of social, political, and regional exclusion of blacks. The postcolonial development of mestizo or mixed-race ideologies of national identity have systematically downplayed African ancestry and social and political involvement in favor of Spanish and Indian heritage and contributions. In addition, a powerful sense of place and belonging has led many peoples of African descent in Central America to identify themselves as something other than African American, reinforcing the tendency of local and foreign scholars to see Central America as peripheral to the African diaspora in the Americas. The essays in this collection begin to recover the forgotten and downplayed histories of blacks in Central America, demonstrating the centrality of African Americans to the region’s history from the earliest colonial times to the present. They reveal how modern nationalist attempts to define mixed-race majorities as “Indo-Hispanic,” or as anything but African American, clash with the historical record of the first region of the Americas in which African Americans not only gained the right to vote but repeatedly held high office, including the presidency, following independence from Spain in 1821.

{"isbn":9780199989317,"title":"Black Ethnics","author":["Christina M. Greer"],"publisher":"Oxford University Press","publishedDate":"2013-06-27","description":"In an age where racial and ethnic identity intersect, intertwine, and interact in increasingly complex ways, Black Ethnics: Race, Immigration, and the Pursuit of the American Dream offers a superb and rigorous analysis of black politics and coalitions in the post-Civil Rights era. Using an original survey of a New York City labor population and multiple national data sources, author Christina M. Greer explores the political significance of ethnicity for new immigrant and native-born blacks. Black Ethnics concludes that racial and ethnic identities affect the ways in which black ethnic groups conceptualize their possibilities for advancement and placement within the American polity. The ethnic and racial dual identity for blacks leads to significant distinctions in political behavior, feelings of incorporation, and policy choices in ways not previously theorized. The steady immigration of black populations from Africa and the Caribbean over the past few decades has fundamentally changed the racial, ethnic, and political landscape in the U.S. An important question for social scientists is how these 'new' blacks will behave politically in the US. Should we expect new black immigrants to orient themselves to politics in the same manner as native Blacks? Will the different histories of the new immigrants and native-born blacks lead to different political orientations and behavior, and perhaps to political tensions and conflict among black ethnic groups residing in America? And to what extent will this new population fracture the black coalition inside of the Democratic party? With increases in immigration of black ethnic populations in the U.S., the political, social, and economic integration processes of black immigrants does not completely echo that of native-born American blacks. The emergent complexity of black intra-racial identity and negotiations within the American polity raise new questions about black political incorporation, assimilation, acceptance, and fulfillment of the American Dream. By comparing Afro-Caribbean and African groups to native-born blacks, this book develops a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the 'new black America' in the twenty-first century. Lastly, Black Ethnics explores how foreign-born blacks create new ways of defining and understanding black politics and coalitions in the post-Civil Rights era.","price":35,"pageCount":212,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780199989317-L.jpg","categories":["Political Science"]}

{"isbn":9781545317099,"title":"Cosmic Consciousness","author":["Richard Maurice Burke"],"publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publishedDate":"2017-04-12","description":"Richard M. Bucke's astonishing treatise on the human mind discusses and attempts to explain mystical experiences in the context of evolutionary change in the brain. During his mid-thirties, Bucke underwent a feeling of intense revelation and felt distinctly enlightened for a short time. Although the period of enlightenment passed, it had an immense impact upon Bucke's outlook, steering his personal and professional life in a directions he had never before envisioned. He found the experience a permanent boon to his well-being, and was able to work and enjoy life more than he formerly had. This book is an attempt to explain the various mystical feelings of enlightenment which humans have experienced over the millennia of recorded history. Bucke's opinion is that these phenomena are becoming commoner over time, and represent an evolution of the human mind. He postulates that these experiences will become commoner as centuries go by, and become accepted as an ordinary, then eventually as a necessary or innate part of human life. The term and title of this book, 'Cosmic Consciousness', is shorthand for the state which human beings enter during a mystical experience. A higher mental echelon free of fear or negative emotions, and characterized by greater perception and understanding of the world, Bucke stresses that Cosmic Consciousness cannot be adequately explained in spoken language. The experience in itself is indescribably different; those who attempt to couch it in words inevitably fall short, or even appear deceptive to other, skeptical individuals. In an attempt to convince the reader that Cosmic Consciousness exists and is already instrumental to the human condition, Bucke examines a series of people he believes also underwent such a state. The figures he discusses include religious figures such as Mohammed and St. John of the Cross, philosophers such as Socrates and Leo Tze, scientists such as Francis Bacon, and authors such as Benedict Spinoza, Walt Whitman and William Blake. This early text of psychology sees Bucke speak freely about the mystical and spiritual aspects of the human mind. At the time, the discipline was in its infancy, and philosophical discussions of unusual, spiritual experiences were a welcome addition. Although many of Bucke's views have been disproved or refuted by testing and research, Cosmic Consciousness continues to be considered a classic for its incisive, frank discussions of unusual experiences. It is today considered a good companion text to the masterwork of William James; The Varieties of Religious Experience.","price":10,"pageCount":204,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781545317099-L.jpg"}

While popular for his tough play and winning personality, the teenager faced racist taunts at opposing arenas. The prejudice he encountered continued at all levels of the game. He became the first African American NHLer when he took to the ice with the Buffalo Sabres in 1982, and in 1987, he was the first Black player of any nationality to skate for the Toronto Maple Leafs. In his two NHL stints, James defined himself as a team player known for his pugilistic skills. As featured in a Fox News Black History Month documentary, on NHL.com, NPR's Morning Edition, ESPN's Olbermann, and in Newsday, the L.A. Times, and the New York Times, Black Ice is the story of a trailblazing athlete who endured and overcame discrimination to realize his dreams and become an inspiration for future generations. This edition includes a new afterword that explores James's legacy.\"--","price":16.95,"pageCount":224,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781770413634-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

{"isbn":9780062379290,"title":"The Cooking Gene","author":["Michael W. Twitty"],"publisher":"Amistad","publishedDate":"2017-08-01","description":"A renowned culinary historian offers a fresh perspective on our most divisive cultural issue, race, in this illuminating memoir of Southern cuisine and food culture that traces his ancestry—both black and white—through food, from Africa to America and slavery to freedom. Southern food is integral to the American culinary tradition, yet the question of who \"owns\" it is one of the most provocative touch points in our ongoing struggles over race. In this unique memoir, culinary historian Michael W. Twitty takes readers to the white-hot center of this fight, tracing the roots of his own family and the charged politics surrounding the origins of soul food, barbecue, and all Southern cuisine. From the tobacco and rice farms of colonial times to plantation kitchens and backbreaking cotton fields, Twitty tells his family story through the foods that enabled his ancestors’ survival across three centuries. He sifts through stories, recipes, genetic tests, and historical documents, and travels from Civil War battlefields in Virginia to synagogues in Alabama to Black-owned organic farms in Georgia. As he takes us through his ancestral culinary history, Twitty suggests that healing may come from embracing the discomfort of the Southern past. Along the way, he reveals a truth that is more than skin deep—the power that food has to bring the kin of the enslaved and their former slaveholders to the table, where they can discover the real America together.

These books, which offered a searing indictment of white theology and society, introduced a radical reappraisal of the Christian message for our time. Combining the visions of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., Cone radically reappraised Christianity from the perspective of the oppressed black community in North America. Forty years later, his work retains its original power, enhanced now by reflections on the evolution of his own thinking and of black theology and on the needs of the present moment.","price":20,"pageCount":166,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781570758959-L.jpg","categories":["Religion"]}

Overlooked have been the efforts that branches of the organization undertook for practical economic and social progress within African-American neighborhoods, frequently in alliance with whites. Yohuru Williams' study of black politics in New Haven culminating in the arrival of the Panthers argues that the increasing militancy in the black community there was motivated not by abstractions of black cultural integrity but by the continuing frustrations the leadership suffered in its dealings with the city's white liberal establishment. Black Politics/White Power is an important contribution to a discovery of the complexities of racial politics during the angry late sixties and early seventies.","price":34.95,"pageCount":240,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781881089605-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

{"isbn":9780738506777,"title":"Fisk University","author":["Rodney T. Cohen"],"publisher":"Arcadia Publishing","publishedDate":"2001","description":"In January of 1866, with the devastation of the Civil War far from assuaged in the slowly recuperating South, Fisk University made its home in abandoned Federal barracks near Nashville, Tennessee. The entire region faced hardships after the conflict, but Southern blacks still encountered what seemed to be insurmountable obstacles, even after the emancipation of slaves. Within five years of its opening, Fisk was in such a dire financial situation, many expected its closure; however, in an effort to raise funds for the university, Professor George L. White and nine students traveled the country performing in a musical ensemble known as the Jubilee Singers. Their hard-won rise to fame led them to the White House where they performed for President Ulysses S. Grant, and the money they earned touring the country literally saved Fisk. The spirit of the first Jubilee Singers lives on at Fisk today, but it is a university much different than the one that opened in 1866. Today Fisk is an institution fully equipped for the challenges of the future, noted for its excellence in academics, and celebrated for the achievements of its distinguished alumni. Whether in the classroom, on the playing field, or on stage, Fisk students and faculty are torchbearers of achievement in all areas of life. It is their unyielding determination that is celebrated within these pages, as the university's history comes to life in vintage photographs. Early classrooms, beloved professors, civic and social organizations, sporting events, famed alumni, and the Jubilee Singers are all included in this retrospective.","price":21.99,"pageCount":128,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780738506777-L.jpg","categories":["Education"]}

Is history destined to repeat itself?Will biblical prophecies come true, and if so, when? It has been more than three decades since Zecharia Sitchin's trailblazing book The 12th Planet brought to life the Sumerian civilization and its record of the Anunnaki—the extraterrestrials who fashioned man and gave mankind civilization and religion. In this new volume, Sitchin shows that the End is anchored in the events of the Beginning, and once you learn of this Beginning, it is possible to foretell the Future. In The End of Days, a masterwork that required thirty years of additional research, Sitchin presents compelling new evidence that the Past is the Future—that mankind and its planet Earth are subject to a predetermined cyclical Celestial Time. In an age when religious fanaticism and a clash of civilizations raise the specter of a nuclear Armageddon, Zecharia Sitchin shatters perceptions and uses history to reveal what is to come at The End of Days.","price":7.99,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780061239212-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Cyntoia Brown was sentenced to life in prison for a murder she committed at the age of sixteen. Her case became national news when celebrities and activists made the hashtag #FreeCyntoia go viral in 2017. She was granted full clemency after having served fifteen years, walking out a free woman on August 7, 2019. This is her story, in her own words. In these pages, written over the fifteen years she was incarcerated, Cyntoia shares the difficult early life that lead to that fateful night and how she found the strength to not only survive, but thrive, in prison. A coming-of-age memoir set against the shocking backdrop of a life behind bars, Free Cyntoia takes you on a spiritual journey as Cyntoia struggles to overcome a legacy of family addiction and a lifetime of feeling ostracized and abandoned by society. Born to a teenage alcoholic mother who was also a victim of sex trafficking, Brown reflects on the isolation, low self-esteem, and sense of alienation that drove her straight into the hands of a predator. Though she attempts to build a positive path and honor the values her beloved adoptive mother taught her, Cyntoia succumbs to harmful influences that drive her to a cycle of promise and despair. After a fateful meeting with a prison educator turned mentor, Cyntoia makes the pivotal decision to take classes at Lipscomb University and strive for a better future, even if she’s never freed. For the first time ever, Cyntoia shares the details of her transformation, including a profound encounter with God, an unlikely romance, and an unprecedented outpouring of support from social media advocates and A-list celebrities, which ultimately lead to clemency and her release from prison. Giving a rare look at the power of love, forgiveness, and self-discovery in the darkest of places, Free Cyntoia is a deeply personal portrait of one woman’s journey for redemption within a system that had failed her from childhood.","price":26,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781982141103-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

Rothstein describes how federal, state, and local governments systematically imposed residential segregation: with undisguised racial zoning, public housing that purposefully segregated previously mixed communities, subsidies for builders to create whites-only suburbs, tax exemptions for institutions that enforced segregation, and support for violent resistance to African Americans in white neighborhoods. He demonstrates that such policies still influence tragedies in places like Ferguson and Baltimore. Scholars have separately described many of these policies, but until now, no author has brought them together to explode the myth of de facto segregation arising from private prejudice or the unintended consequences of economic forces. Like The New Jim Crow, Rothstein's groundbreaking history forces us to face the obligation to remedy our unconstitutional past.","price":27.95,"pageCount":336,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781631492853-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Indeed a book is better than a great house with a solid foundation or a stela in the temple\" (Karenga, 1984, p. 84). Today, we, and our children, are subject to gangsterized and criminalized images of African people in America in the attempt to justify our extermination. Sophisticated mass media manipulation places these images in broad circulation. Miseducation in many public schools aids this process with textbooks that are woefully insufficient and teachers who lack cultural competence. This book marks the beginning of a highly anticipated series to increase our cultural competence by one of our great Master Teachers. Professor Kaba Kamene is a trusted Elder, a Seba (Master Teacher) who opens the door to the Universe so that his students may shine like a star\" (Obenga). His work as an African-centered educator with over 30 years of public school teaching experience, scholar and professor of Black Studies, represents the continuation of a powerful priestly Kemetic cultural tradition that is essentially African. Professor Kamene has a track record of producing excellence in some of the most challenging urban schools and the rare distinction of demonstrating this excellence in working with students from Pre-K to post-doctorate. He is a living library who has apprenticed under sacred African Master Teachers like Dr. John Henrik Clarke and Dr. Asa Hilliard. The Maafa is the catastrophic interruption of African sovereignty and civilization. It includes far more than \"slavery\" and lynching and it is still going on. To emerge in the midst of our captivity with any semblance of African consciousness is nothing short of a miracle, given the fact that the best minds of Europe and America have been put to the task of ensuring that our culture and consciousness be obliterated. This book is a literary libation that elevates and celebrates the life and legacy of William Leo Hansberry, the Father of Black Studies. He had the character, consciousness and commitment to \"rescue and reconstruct our history and put it back into the hands of those who created it\" (Karenga, 1984). Professor Hansberry, along with Professor Kaba Kamene, constitute a small cadre of keepers of the culture who have labored in the face of continuous high-tech attempts to erase our culture. This book is a gift and a treasure. Like the ones that will follow it in this series it is a critical piece in the puzzle for our cultural reconstruction and identity restoration. As my grandmother used to instruct me and my siblings growing up, \"read and be wise.\" Chike Akua, Teacher Transformation Institute Author of Education for Transformation: The Keys to Releasing the Genius of African American Students Please confirm that you have received this and that is sufficient.

It seems that wherever Aria goes, someone wants to touch her hair. In the street, strangers reach for her fluffy curls; and even under the sea, in the jungle, and in space, she's chased by a mermaid, monkeys, and poked by aliens...until, finally, Aria has had enough! This humorous picture book speaks to a national conversation on strangers touching black hair, and sparks an important conversation on personal boundaries for children as Aria explains that her hair should not be touched without asking for permission first. Commercial, imaginative, and fun, Don't Touch My Hair! can be used to teach young readers about personal boundaries and asking for permission--and that it's all right to be told \"no\" as well. Sharee Miller takes the tradition of appreciation of black hair to a fresh, commercial level, as she doesn't seek to convince or remind young readers that their curls are beautiful--she simply acknowledges black beauty while telling a fun, imaginative story.","price":7.99,"pageCount":40,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780316562577-L.jpg","categories":["Juvenile Fiction"]}

Niall Ferguson's House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848 was hailed as a \"great biography\" by Time magazine and named one of the best books of the year by Business Week. Now, with all the depth, clarity and drama with which he traced their ascent, Ferguson - the first historian with access to the long-lost Rothschild family archives - concludes his myth-breaking portrait of once of the most fascinating and power families of all time. From Crimea to World War II, wars repeatedly threatened the stability of the Rothschilds' worldwide empire. Despite these many global upheavals, theirs remained the biggest bank in the world up until the First World War, their interests extending far beyond the realm of finance. Yet the Rothschilds' failure to establish themselves successfully in the United States proved fateful, and as financial power shifted from London to New York after 1914, their power waned. \"A stupendous achievement, a triumph of historical research and imagination.\"—Robert Skidelsky, The New York Review of Books \"Niall Ferguson's brilliant and altogether enthralling two-volume family saga proves that academic historians can still tell great stories that the rest of us want to read.\"—The New York Times Book Review \"Superb ...

Spirit possession is an integral part of shamanism as well as many neo-pagan forms of worship that draw down deities or invite spirit possession. However, spirit possession is not for the unprepared. In Drawing Down the Spirits, Kenaz Filan and Raven Kaldera, both initiated and experienced in shamanic and Vodou traditions, present the practical guidance needed to participate in ritual possession. Addressing the benefits and the dangers that await the naive, Filan and Kaldera show that there is no such thing as a guaranteed “safe” possession because spirits have their own agenda--and they are much more powerful than we are. The authors provide a variety of techniques to prepare for possession and abort possession and to promote the safety of the possessed as well as the spirits and witnesses present. With a wide-ranging look at the historic forms of ritual possession found throughout the world--including Uganda, Nepal, Korea, Bali, Greece, Turkey, Scandinavia, and France--the authors also include numerous firsthand accounts collected from witnesses of modern spirit possession.","price":18.95,"pageCount":352,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594772696-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

{"isbn":9781603587617,"title":"Farming While Black","author":["Leah Penniman"],"publisher":"Chelsea Green Publishing","publishedDate":"2018-10-30","description":"In 1920, 14 percent of all land-owning US farmers were black. Today less than 2 percent of farms are controlled by black people--a loss of over 14 million acres and the result of discrimination and dispossession. While farm management is among the whitest of professions, farm labor is predominantly brown and exploited, and people of color disproportionately live in \"food apartheid\" neighborhoods and suffer from diet-related illness. The system is built on stolen land and stolen labor and needs a redesign. Farming While Black is the first comprehensive \"how to\" guide for aspiring African-heritage growers to reclaim their dignity as agriculturists and for all farmers to understand the distinct, technical contributions of African-heritage people to sustainable agriculture. At Soul Fire Farm, author Leah Penniman co-created the Black and Latinx Farmers Immersion (BLFI) program as a container for new farmers to share growing skills in a culturally relevant and supportive environment led by people of color. Farming While Black organizes and expands upon the curriculum of the BLFI to provide readers with a concise guide to all aspects of small-scale farming, from business planning to preserving the harvest. Throughout the chapters Penniman uplifts the wisdom of the African diasporic farmers and activists whose work informs the techniques described--from whole farm planning, soil fertility, seed selection, and agroecology, to using whole foods in culturally appropriate recipes, sharing stories of ancestors, and tools for healing from the trauma associated with slavery and economic exploitation on the land. Woven throughout the book is the story of Soul Fire Farm, a national leader in the food justice movement. The technical information is designed for farmers and gardeners with beginning to intermediate experience. For those with more experience, the book provides a fresh lens on practices that may have been taken for granted as ahistorical or strictly European. Black ancestors and contemporaries have always been leaders--and continue to lead--in the sustainable agriculture and food justice movements. It is time for all of us to listen.","price":34.95,"pageCount":368,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781603587617-L.jpg","categories":["African American farmers"]}

Accused of attempting to rape a white woman, Dick Rowland was with little doubt about to be lynched. But in another part of town, a small group of black men, many of them World War I veterans, decided to risk lives for a different vision of justice. Before it was all over, Tulsa had erupted into one of America's worst racial nightmares, leaving scores dead and hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed. Exhaustively researched, Death in a Promised Land is the compelling story of racial ideologies, southwestern politics, and yellow journalism, and of an embattled black community's struggle to hold onto its land and freedom. More than just the chronicle of one of the nation's most devastating race riots, this critically acclaimed study of American race relations is, above all, a gripping story of terror and lawlessness, and of courage, heroism, and human perseverance.","price":20,"pageCount":184,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780807117675-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Glimpses of them can arise at any age in the form of intuitive dreams, déjà vu, spontaneous visions, and out-of-body experiences. Most people dismiss these experiences. However, by embracing these gifts, we can unlock our shamanic potential to change ourselves and the world around us. Revealing his transformation from skeptic to respected shamanic healer, Itzhak Beery explains how, after countless prescient dreams and visions throughout his life that he brushed off, a series of synchronistic events led to his first shamanism workshop with Michael Harner, renowned shamanism scholar and teacher. This, in turn, led to a trip to South America with John Perkins to work with indigenous shamanic healers. Beery shares his experiences with ayahuasca rituals in the Amazon, messages from power animals and plant spirits, dreams that foretold future events, and holographic sightings of past lives and spiritual entities, both evil and benign. He details his shamanic way of “seeing” to diagnose spiritual, emotional, and physical ailments via candle readings and remote viewing. Explaining how we are always surrounded by spirits, he recounts helping people communicate with loved ones who have passed on and shares powerful stories of soul retrieval during shamanic journeys to other worlds. Through his true stories of visions that manifested in reality, Beery reveals that we are all shamans. By igniting our natural intuition and developing trust for our inner powers, we can each connect to the oneness of nature where all knowledge is found.","price":16.95,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781620553725-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

Vincent Woodard takes the enslaved person’s claims of human consumption seriously, focusing on both the literal starvation of the slave and the tropes of cannibalism on the part of the slaveholder, and further draws attention to the ways in which Blacks experienced their consumption as a fundamentally homoerotic occurrence. The Delectable Negro explores these connections between homoeroticism, cannibalism, and cultures of consumption in the context of American literature and US slave culture. Utilizing many staples of African American literature and culture, such as the slave narratives of OlaudahEquiano, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass, as well as other less circulated materials like James L. Smith’s slave narrative, runaway slave advertisements, and numerous articles from Black newspapers published in the nineteenth century, Woodard traces the racial assumptions, political aspirations, gender codes, and philosophical frameworks that dictated both European and white American arousal towards Black males and hunger for Black male flesh. Woodard uses these texts to unpack how slaves struggled not only against social consumption, but also against endemic mechanisms of starvation and hunger designed to break them. He concludes with an examination of the controversial chain gang oral sex scene in Toni Morrison’s Beloved, suggesting that even at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century, we are still at a loss for language with which to describe Black male hunger within a plantation culture of consumption.","price":45,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780814794623-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

{"isbn":9781937584924,"title":"Drugs As Weapons Against Us","author":["John L. Potash"],"publishedDate":"2015-05-01","description":"Drugs as Weapons Against Us meticulously details how a group of opium-trafficking families came to form an American oligarchy and eventually achieved global dominance. This oligarchy helped fund the Nazi regime and then saved thousands of Nazis to work with the Central Intelligence Agency. CIA operations such as MK-Ultra pushed LSD and other drugs on leftist leaders and left-leaning populations at home and abroad. Evidence supports that this oligarchy further led the United States into its longest-running wars in the ideal areas for opium crops, while also massively funding wars in areas of coca plant abundance for cocaine production under the guise of a “war on drugs” that is actually the use of drugs as a war on us. Drugs as Weapons Against Us tells how scores of undercover U.S. Intelligence agents used drugs in the targeting of leftist leaders from SDS to the Black Panthers, Young Lords, Latin Kings, and the Occupy Movement. It also tells how they particularly targeted leftist musicians, including John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, and Tupac Shakur to promote drugs while later murdering them when they started sobering up and taking on more leftist activism. The book further uncovers the evidence that Intelligence agents dosed Paul Robeson with LSD, gave Mick Jagger his first hit of acid, hooked Janis Joplin on amphetamines, as well as manipulating Elvis Presley, Eminem, the Wu Tang Clan, and others.","price":24.95,"pageCount":456,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781937584924-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Uncovering compelling new evidence, Egyptologist Robert Bauval and astrophysicist Thomas Brophy present the anthropological, climatological, archaeological, geological, and genetic research supporting this hugely debated theory of the black African origin of Egyptian civilization. Building upon extensive studies from the past four decades and their own archaeoastronomical and hieroglyphic research, the authors show how the early black culture known as the Cattle People not only domesticated cattle but also had a sophisticated grasp of astronomy; created plentiful rock art at Gilf Kebir and Gebel Uwainat; had trade routes to the Mediterranean coast, central Africa, and the Sinai; held spiritual and occult ceremonies; and constructed a stone calendar circle and megaliths at the ceremonial site of Nabta Playa reminiscent of Stonehenge, yet much older. Revealing these “Star People” as the true founders of ancient Egyptian civilization, this book completely rewrites the history of world civilization, placing black Africa back in its rightful place at the center of mankind’s origins.","price":20,"pageCount":384,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591431145-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

Over 40 percent of the total volume of captive Africans arrived in Brazil during a 400-year period of legal and contraband transatlantic slaving. If slavery penetrated every aspect of Brazilian life, so did resistance--and co-existence with it--in the form of small to large-scale quilombos. Palmares and the other quilombos built an exciting history of freedom. Yet, it is a history filled with traps and surprises, advances and setbacks, conflict and commitments, while advancing their immediate interests and more ambitious projects of liberty.

The Book of God has been called 'the bible of the Black God,' as it presents a wide range of scientific, historical, and scriptural evidence demonstrating that the Original Black Man is the God of the world's religious traditions, from the religious traditions of the Ancient Near and Far East such as Kemet (Egypt) and India to the Biblical religions and Islam. The Book of God answers such questions as: How is the Black Man God and what does this mean? What is God's relationship to spirit and matter? What does Albert Einstein's mathematical revelation E=mc2 have to do with the Reality of God? If the Original Black Man is God, Who is the Original Black Woman? Is there evidence of the reality of the Twenty Four Scientists? Who is Master Fard Muhammad? Was he actually an ex-con named Wallie Ford who served time in San Quentin on a drug charge? And more. The Book of God also demonstrates that: The God of the ancient religious traditions around the world was a self-created Black God. The Six Days of Creation in the book of Genesis chronicles the Black God's Six Trillion year evolution. The ancient sacred texts of the Original Man and Woman from around the world agree with the Hon. Elijah Muhammad's Teaching on God. The fields of Genetics and Hebrew Sacred Tradition converge to reveal that the Essence of the Creator inhabits the very genetic makeup of the Original Man and Woman. The Secret of the ancient Mysteries, the Masonic Lodge and Shrine, and the Church of Rome is the Reality of the Black God. Astrophysical evidence and ancient tradition converge to support the Hon. Elijah Muhammad's teaching on the Deportation of the Moon by a Black God. And much more.","price":28,"pageCount":426,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780982161876-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

The lives of black women in American politics are remarkably absent from the shelves of bookstores and libraries. For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics is a sweeping view of American history from the vantage points of four women who have lived and worked behind the scenes in politics for over thirty years—Donna Brazile, Yolanda Caraway, Leah Daughtry, and Minyon Moore—a group of women who call themselves The Colored Girls. Like many people who have spent their careers in public service, they view their lives in four-year waves where presidential campaigns and elections have been common threads. For most of the Colored Girls, their story starts with Jesse Jackson’s first campaign for president. From there, they went on to work on the presidential campaigns of Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Over the years, they’ve filled many roles: in the corporate world, on campaigns, in unions, in churches, in their own businesses and in the White House. Through all of this, they’ve worked with those who have shaped our country’s history—US Presidents such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, well-known political figures such as Terry McAuliffe and Howard Dean, and legendary activists and historical figures such as Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, and Betty Shabazz. For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics is filled with personal stories that bring to life heroic figures we all know and introduce us to some of those who’ve worked behind the scenes but are still hidden. Whatever their perch, the Colored Girls are always focused on the larger goal of “hurrying history” so that every American — regardless of race, gender or religious background — can have a seat at the table. This is their story.","price":28.99,"pageCount":336,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781250137715-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

{"isbn":9780807076408,"title":"Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich","author":["Mary Frances Berry"],"publisher":"Beacon Press","publishedDate":"2016","description":"A timely and nonpartisan book on voter manipulation and electoral corruption--and the importance of stimulating voter turnout and participation Though voting rights are fundamental to American democracy, felon disfranchisement, voter identification laws, and hard-to-access polling locations with limited hours are a few of the ways voter turnout is suppressed. These methods of voter suppression are pernicious, but in Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, Dr. Mary Frances Berry focuses on forms of corruption including vote buying, vote hauling, the abuse of absentee ballots, and other illegal practices by candidates and their middlemen, often in collusion with local election officials. Vote buying--whether it's for a few dollars, a beer, or a pack of cigarettes--is offered to individual citizens in order to ensure votes for a particular candidate, and Dr. Berry notes it occurs across party lines, with Republicans, Democrats, and independents all participating. Dr. Berry shares the compelling story of Greg Malveaux, former director of Louisiana's Vote Fraud Division, and how this \"everyman\" tried to clean up elections in a state notorious for corruption. Malveaux discovered virtually every type of electoral fraud during his tenure and saw firsthand how abuses occurred in local communities--from city councils to coroners' offices. In spite of Sisyphean persistence, he found it virtually impossible to challenge the status quo. Dr. Berry reveals how this type of electoral abuse is rampant across the country and includes myriad examples from other states, including Illinois, Texas, Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi. Voter manipulation is rarely exposed and may be perceived as relatively innocuous, however; Dr. Berry observes that in addition to undermining basic democracy, it also leads to a profound lack of accountability and a total disconnect between politicians and their constituents, and that those in poor and minority communities are the most vulnerable. While reforming campaign finance laws are undeniably important to our democracy, being attuned to issues of structural powerlessness and poverty, and to the cycles that perpetuate them, is no less crucial. In Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, Dr. Berry shares specific successful voting strategies that other countries have adopted and urges creativity in rewarding people for voting. She also underscores the continued importance of grassroots education, so that citizens see voting as desirable and empowering--as a tool to help create the kind of environment they deserve.","price":25.95,"pageCount":186,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780807076408-L.jpg","categories":["Elections"]}

The metaphoric tale each spiritual figure embodies is not unique, however, but found in many cultures long before the Christian era.

In developing such a fabrication, this multinational cabal drew upon a multitude of myths and rituals that existed long before the Christian era, and reworked them for centuries into the religion passed down to us today. Contrary to popular belief, there was no single man who was at the genesis of Christianity; Jesus was many characters rolled into one. These characters personified the ubiquitous solar myth, and their exploits were well known, as reflected by such popular deities as Mithras, Heracles/Hercules, Dionysos and many others throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. The story of Jesus as portrayed in the Gospels is revealed to be nearly identical in detail to that of the earlier savior-gods Krishna and Horus, who for millennia preceding Christianity held great favor with the people. The Christ Conspiracy shows the Jesus character as not unique or original, not âeoedivine revelation.âe Christianity reinterprets the same extremely ancient body of knowledge that revolved around the celestial bodies and natural forces. The result of this myth making has been âeoeThe Greatest Conspiracy Ever Sold.âe","price":19.95,"pageCount":431,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780932813749-L.jpg","categories":["Religion"]}
{"isbn":9781591433019,"title":"The Egyptian Origins of King David and the Temple of Solomon","author":["Ahmed Osman"],"publisher":"Bear","publishedDate":"2019-02-05","description":"An investigation into the real historical figure of King David and the real location of the Temple of Solomon • Identifies King David as Pharaoh Tuthmosis III of the 18th Dynasty and David’s son Solomon as Pharaoh Amenhotep, Tuthmosis’s successor • Shows how the Temple of Solomon described in the Bible corresponds with the Mortuary Temple of Luxor in Egypt • Explains how David was not a descendant of Isaac but his father and how biblical narrators changed the original story of Abraham and Isaac to hide his Egyptian identity During the last two centuries, thousands of ancient documents from different sites in the Middle East have been uncovered. However, no archaeological discovery speaks of King David or Solomon, his son and successor, directly or in directly. Was King David a real person or a legend like King Arthur? Proposing that David was a genuine historical figure, Ahmed Osman explores how his identity may be radically different than what is described in religious texts. Drawing on recent archaeological, historical, and biblical evidence from Egypt, Osman shows that David lived in Thebes, Egypt, rather than Jerusalem; that he lived five centuries earlier than previously thought, during the 15th rather than the 10th century B.C.; and that David was not a descendant of Isaac but was, in fact, Isaac’s father. The author also reveals David’s true Egyptian identity: Pharaoh Tuthmosis III of the 18th Dynasty. Confirming evidence from rabbinic literature that indicates Isaac was not Abraham’s son, despite the version provided in Genesis, Osman demonstrates how biblical narrators replaced David with Abraham the Hebrew to hide the Egyptian identity of Isaac’s father. He shows how Egyptian historical and archaeological sources depict figures that match David’s and Solomon’s known characteristics in many ways, including accounts of a great empire between the Euphrates and the Nile that corresponds with David’s empire as described in the Bible. Extending his research further, the author shows that King Solomon, King David’s son, corresponds in reality to Pharaoh Amenhotep, successor of Tuthmosis III, the pharaoh who stands out in the dynastic history of Egypt not only for his peaceful reign but also as the builder of the Temple of Luxor and the famed Mortuary Temple at Luxor, which matches the biblical descriptions of Solomon’s Temple. Unveiling the real history behind the biblical story of King David, Osman reveals that the great ancestor of the Israelites was, in fact, Egyptian.","price":18,"pageCount":240,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591433019-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}
{"isbn":9789766403492,"title":"Britain's Black Debt","author":["Hilary Beckles"],"publisher":"University of the West Indies Press","publishedDate":"2013","description":"Since the mid-nineteenth-century abolition of slavery, the call for reparations for the crime of African enslavement and native genocide has been growing. In the Caribbean, grassroots and official voices now constitute a regional reparations movement. While it remains a fractured, contentious and divisive call, it generates considerable public interest, especially within sections of the community that are concerned with issues of social justice, equity, civil and human rights, education, and cultural identity. The reparations discourse has been shaped by the voices from these fields as they seek to build a future upon the settlement of historical crimes. This is the first scholarly work that looks comprehensively at the reparations discussion in the Caribbean. Written by a leading economic historian of the region, a seasoned activist in the wider movement for social justice and advocacy of historical truth, Britain's Black Debt looks at the origins and development of reparations as a regional and international process. Weaving together detailed historical data on Caribbean slavery and the transatlantic slave trade with legal principles and the politics of postcolonialism, the author sets out a solid academic analysis of the evidence. He concludes that Britain has a case of reparations to answer which the Caribbean should litigate. The presentation of rich empirical historical data on Britain's transatlantic slave economy and society supports the legal claim that chattel slavery as established by the British state and sustained by citizens and governments was understood then as a crime, but political and moral outrage were silenced by the argument that the enslavement of black people was in Britain's national interest. International law provides that chattel slavery as practised by Britain was a crime against humanity. Slavery was invested in by the royal family, the government, the established church, most elite families, and large public institutions in the private and public sector. Citing the legal principles of unjust and criminal enrichment, the author presents a compelling argument for Britain's payment of its black debt, a debt that it continues to deny in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Britain's Black Debt brings together the evidence and arguments that the general public and expert policymakers have long called for. It is at once an exciting narration of Britain's dominance of the slave markets that enriched the economy and a seminal conceptual journey into the hidden politics and public posturing of leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. No work of this kind has ever been attempted. No author has had the diversity of historical research skills, national and international political involvement, and personal engagement as an activist to present such a complex yet accessible work of scholarship for both activists and academics.","price":24.95,"pageCount":292,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9789766403492-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

In the first section of this book, the Sankofa approach is utilized. This entails looking back to history as a foundation for dance. This allows for a better understanding of the present in an effort to best shape the future. In the first segment of this publication, a snapshot view of the history of African dance and its relationship to the evolution of African American dance is explored. In the next section, segment, the state of African American health is reviewed to substantiate why moving and exercising, through dancing, matters. Current health challenges of African Americans are detailed. This book then examines the physical, mental and spiritual benefits of dance. These advantages can aid in circumventing health issues that are quite prevalent among Black people. The third segment of this publication presents responses from dancers regarding why they dance. Dancers share their impressions of the benefits, challenges, and experiences that are associated with the art. This section concludes with a special poem written by one of the Washington Park Senior Line Dancers. The Addendum provides additional information regarding Tips for New Dancers, Information regarding African Dances, and the Survey Instrument. Readers are also encouraged to use the pages that follow to consider their dance strengths, challenges and aspirations. Hopefully, each segment of Dance: It's in our DNA will inform readers about the role, evolution and continued importance of dance among African Americans.

Mitchell is exposing us all to this system which is a more advanced and subtle version of willie lynchism. Whereas during slavery they verbalized \"light skin slaves in the house, dark skin slaves in the field,\" the system of self hate achieves the same goals covertly. This time it wasn't about separating us by skin color but separating us by talent and potential. They lure the best Africans in America to assimilate into white American culture for the sole purpose of keeping our best from helping the rest.

The entire historical timeline of African Americans is addressed, from the Colonial period through the civil rights upheavals of the late 1950s to 1961, the time of publication. \"Before the Mayflower\" grew out of a series of articles Bennett published in Ebony magazine regarding \"the trials and triumphs of a group of Americans whose roots in the American soil are deeper than the roots of the Puritans who arrived on the celebrated Mayflower a year after a 'Dutch man of war' deposited twenty Negroes at Jamestown.\" Bennett's history is infused with a desire to set the record straight about black contributions to the Americas and about the powerful Africans of antiquity. While not a fresh history, it provides a solid synthesis of current historical research and a lively writing style that makes it accessible and engaging reading. After discussing the contributions of Africans to the ancient world, \"Before the Mayflower\" tells the history of \"the other Americans,\" how they came to America, and what happened to them when they got here. The book is comprehensive and detailed, providing little-known and often overlooked facts about the lives of black folks through slavery, Reconstruction, America's wars, the Great Depression, and the civil rights movement. The book includes a useful time line and some fascinating archival images.","price":24.95,"pageCount":418,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781684220403-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

His higher passions are balanced by his lower passions & are referred to as his Godly desires & Devilish desires. Anything outside the realm of God's Laws, Nature or Truth is \"termed\" Devil. Devil is any Nation, Person, Food, Dress Code, Language, or even Money that is used in a manner that is contrary to Nature (natural living), God's written word or the Perpetuation of Life. The European world that is controlling the Black, Brown, Red, & Yellow nations of earth today are ruling like a Devil. This is why Revelation 20 v7-8 refers to them as Satan or Gog & Magog let loose on the four corners of the earth. The Muslim world refers to the European Community as the Devil because of their Behavior with other nations of earth. This perspective can be changed with a change in Deeds & Behavior. Europeans are ruling according to their lower passions! THE BLACKMAN'S STOLEN BIRTHRIGHT is this Divine Knowledge that was stolen from him during slavery via a process of Mental Birth Control.

{"isbn":9781591431855,"title":"DNA of the Gods","author":["Chris H. Hardy"],"publisher":"Bear","publishedDate":"2014-03-21","description":"An in-depth study of humanity’s Anunnaki origins and the Anunnaki battle for an intelligent versus enslaved humanity • Explains the genetic engineering of humanity by an Anunnaki scientist Ninmah • Shows how the concepts of sin and the inferiority of women arose from Enlil’s will to keep humanity underdeveloped, clashing with Enki’s and Ninmah’s plan to make us equal in intelligence • Reveals how humanity’s long history of conflict was shaped by the battle between Enki and his brother Enlil Further developing the revolutionary work of Zecharia Sitchin, Chris Hardy shows that the “gods” of ancient myth, visitors from the planet Nibiru, created us using their own “divine” DNA--first through DNA extraction from their own ribs’ marrow and later by direct relations with early human females. Drawing upon multiple sacred texts, Hardy details the genetic engineering of humanity by Anunnaki scientist Ninmah, with the help of Enki and Hermes. She reveals how Ninmah’s first female human creation, Tiamat/Eve, contained more alien DNA than the earlier male one, Adamu, and how the biblical Noah represents the perfection of her work. Examining the war between Anunnaki brothers Enki and Enlil, Hardy reveals how the concepts of sin and the inferiority of women were born out of Enlil’s attempts to enslave and then wipe out humanity, repeatedly thwarted by Enki and Ninmah. The author further explains how the sacred sexuality taught to humans--still seen in Tantric practice--became suppressed millennia later by the patriarchal concept of original sin and how innocent Eve took the blame for the expulsion from Eden and fall from Grace. Showing that the god who created us was not the same god who expelled us from Eden, Hardy explains that there will be no apocalypse because the Good/Evil duality has never truly existed--it has been only enemy gods fighting and implicating humanity in the wake of their own competition for power. With a full psychological understanding of how the ancient “gods” have shaped humanity’s ongoing history of conflict, we can move beyond the framework of “(my) Good versus (your) Evil” imposed by Enlil and begin to steer our own planetary destiny.","price":18,"pageCount":264,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591431855-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

But as Dying of Whiteness shows, the policies that result actually place white Americans at ever-greater risk of sickness and death. Physician Jonathan M. Metzl's quest to understand the health implications of \"backlash governance\" leads him across America's heartland. Interviewing a range of everyday Americans, he examines how racial resentment fueled pro-gun laws in Missouri, resistance to the Affordable Care Act in Tennessee, and huge spending cuts in Kansas. And he shows these policies' costs: increasing deaths by gun suicide, rising dropout rates, and falling life expectancies. White Americans, Metzl argues, must reject the racial hierarchies that promise to aid them but in fact threaten their demise.","price":32,"pageCount":336,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781541644984-L.jpg","categories":["Medical"]}

Also included are examples of similar practices that existed in Haiti, Cuba, and other parts of the West Indies, reflecting New Orleans' relationship with Caribbean countries and shedding light on Congo Square's role in extending and perpetuating African music and dance in North America. The amalgamation of those practices influenced indigenous New Orleans performance styles as well performance forms on the national level.Written in a language accessible to the general public and students on the undergraduate as well as secondary level, this book includes an innovative timeline, maps, graphic images, extensive endnotes, and bibliographic references.

Mary Ellen Pleasant, used her Gold Rush wealth to further the cause of abolitionist John Brown. Robert Reed Church, became the largest landowner in Tennessee. Hannah Elias, the mistress of a New York City millionaire, used the land her lover gave her to build an empire in Harlem. Orphan and self-taught chemist Annie Turnbo-Malone, developed the first national brand of hair care products. Mississippi school teacher O. W. Gurley, developed a piece of Tulsa, Oklahoma, into a “town” for wealthy black professionals and craftsmen that would become known as “the Black Wall Street.” Although Madam C. J Walker was given the title of America’s first female black millionaire, she was not. She was the first, however, to flaunt and openly claim her wealth—a dangerous and revolutionary act. Nearly all the unforgettable personalities in this amazing collection were often attacked, demonized, or swindled out of their wealth.

I had a dream that one day even the city of Chicago, a city drowning in the ocean of self-hating black on black crime, will be transformed into a town of Blacks, Native, and Hispanics who love each other as brothers and sisters of Israel. I had a dream that one day, over in the city of Los Angeles, with its racial history of police brutality, and outright killing of Gods elect, one day my people will turn back to God. They will return to his commandments, and the Lord will hear their cries and repay the heathen one hundred-fold for the blood of the children of Israel which was shed all over this land. I had a dream. I had a dream that one day every ghetto shall be exalted, every skyscraper shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. This is my faith, the belief that God will break the yoke of our oppression and sit our oppressor down in the miry clay. And Gods angels shall separate the wheat from the tare, the oppressed from the oppressor, and the children of God from the Synagogue of Satan. On that day, God's children will finally have rest. If America was made to be a great nation from the genocide of the Native American, the enslavement of the so-called Black American, and the oppression of Hispanics, this must become true. So let God's judgment ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let God's Judgment ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let God's judgment ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let God's Judgment ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let Gods Judgment ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let God's Judgment ring from the Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let God's Judgment ring from the Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let God's Judgment ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let God's Judgment ring. And when this happens, when God's Judgment rings from every state and every city, We will no longer fear for our lives, we will no longer be ashamed of being black, we will no longer hate one another, we will no longer fear Satan. Our fear shall be in the power of the Almighty, and we will know that he is LORD.","price":20,"pageCount":272,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781727899139-L.jpg"}

However, being aware of his history, he tells the young eagles of the richness of their culture and heritage.When the wings of the great eagle grow in full, he encourages and inspires the other young eagles to realize their potential and to soar into the clouds.This story offers many parallels to behaviors in the classrooms and on school playgrounds where children are teased by schoolyard \"chickens\" and bullied by schoolyard \"roosters\" because of their differences, and, where entire classrooms of children, through clowning or put-downs, disrupt the learning process, changing classrooms from eagles' nests into chicken yards!

This volume shows that African priest-scholars of the Egyptian Mystery System originated philosophy; that Thales, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle lived in Africa and studied under these priests. Some Greek historians: Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle; and modern writers: William Stace, Alfred Benn, James Breasted, etc. testify to Greeks' studentship in Egypt. Citing Egyptian texts, the author reveals that the doctrines of Greek philosophers have their prototypes in earlier Egyptian philosophy. However, in their determination to maintain racial and intellectual superiority over Africans, Western historians, since the 18th century, subverted history by attributing the origin of philosophy to the Greeks. The author calls for the restoration of \"truth\" to the history of the \"king\" of disciplines---Philosophy.","price":24.95,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781419613050-L.jpg","categories":["Philosophy"]}

Some scholars assert that African American Studies use a well-defined common approach in examining history, politics, and the family in the same way as scholars in the disciplines of economics, sociology, and political science. Other scholars consider African American Studies multidisciplinary, a field somewhat comparable to the field of education in which scholars employ a variety of disciplinary lenses-be they anthropological, psychological, historical, etc., --to study the African world experience. In this model the boundaries between traditional disciplines are accepted, and researches in African American Studies simply conduct discipline based an analysis of particular topics. Finally, another group of scholars insists that African American Studies is interdisciplinary, an enterprise that generates distinctive analyses by combining perspectives from different traditional disciplines and synthesizing them into a unique framework of analysis.","price":34.95,"pageCount":430,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781580730396-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Here, at her most provacative and intensely personel, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness. As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explode th question \"What is love?\" her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society's failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the \"100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.\" All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can.","price":15.99,"pageCount":272,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780060959470-L.jpg","categories":["Family & Relationships"]}

{"isbn":9780615648637,"title":"Ancestor Paths","author":["Aladokun"],"publishedDate":"2012-06-01","description":"Have you ever had an unexplained phenomena - a knock at the door but no one there; the hairs on your arm stand up, as though you're suddenly chilled; a gradual aroma rising from nowhere; an abrupt noise; a strange sensation on different parts of your body, like someone stroking your hair; or dreams of your deceased loved ones? These are just a few examples of how your ancestors and spirit guides may be trying to gain your attention. Are you curious, WHY? Perhaps the world is divided into two kinds of people; those who can only fathom the solid material life (the visible world) and those who perceive that there is an active spiritual presence (an invisible reality) operative in most of our lives. Whether this perception is faint or fully actualized, the book Ancestor Paths is the ultimate road map to developing a clear understanding of the spirit world and why spirits try to commune with the living. It also explains how our lives are enhanced and healed through positive interaction with spirit. This book is filled with clear, understandable information on communing with those on the other side and provides outstanding insight on how your spiritual skills and talents can be developed to aid you and your family. Ancestral reverence is as old as human beings and has always been understood as a powerful force for individual, family, cultural and community strength and stability. The Lukumi/Yoruba priestess Aladokun, illuminates how honoring your ancestors and working with your guides can add enormous clarity, direction and peace to your life. Her soothing explanations, advice, caveats, counseling, and explicit directions makes you feel as if you have the most supportive teacher in the world. In a clear and easy to read narrative, she guides us through the infrastructure of the spirit realm, helping us to understand that our divine relationships continue and supports us in our spiritual growth. This guide, newly expanded, is filled with cogent answers to some of the worse misunderstandings we all have about spirit work. She's able to remove the irrational fear we sometimes have of our ancient practices, simplifying the rules of contact for building strong spiritual relationships. No matter where you are on the belief continuum, intrepid beginner or sage spirit practitioner, the comprehensive way this guide is written will make you keep it close at hand. The basics are well covered but it also takes us deeper into the secrets of self preparation, ritual and the power of prayer. She helps us to see that this is not just a curiosity or a hobby, but perhaps the most effective way for us to evolve ourselves, our families and the world. If you're a beginner, with your heart leading you deeper into spirit connection, you won't find a better step by step primer on developing your skills and natural talents. If you're an experienced spiritualist/practitioner, you'll be inspired in all new ways with newly added prayers, quotes and anecdotes that strengthen your understanding of why this work is sacred and the most important work that we do; the perfect book to support your work in guiding your students, clients, and godchildren on their spiritual path. And for the curious, you'll get an honest rendition about spirit life, gain some powerful insights, and, hopefully, become inspired by the stories and processes as revealed by an authentic priestess, Aladokun. Lastly, Ancestor Paths is a tribute to all divinities within the universe that continue to guide, bless, and elevate our souls towards higher consciousness and enlightenment.","price":21.95,"pageCount":270,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780615648637-L.jpg"}

The Apollo Memorial, is an attempt to capture photographically the essence and philosophic outpouring of love and affection offered for Michael Jackson, a truly incredible legend and wonderful product of the Apollo Theater, where so many have gotten their start. The first Amateur Night at the Apollo began in 1934 and since, the stellar list of legends to grace American music history includes Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Billy Holiday and Sammy Davis, among others. Now, upon Michael's passing, Rev. Al Sharpton, incisively avant-garde as he always is, called for the celebration not simply to honor this great artiste but also to help shape the overall response that would ensue in wake of Michael's public and private persona. Naturally, because of Michael's great talents that have serenaded so many for so long, the community from far and wide thought it fitting this magnanimous hero should be remembered Harlem, New York, style. This is reflected in fact that the Apollo theater is one of Harlem, New York City's and America's most enduring cultural institution. In that vein, Michael's fans came to give him the thunderous ?Wake? fitting for the charismatic megastar that Michael really was. In retrospect, with Sharpton stewarding the tribute, the ?wolves? were forced to tow the line and with that the show beautifully unfolded with thunderous spirituality hovering, musically and mystically, while financially rewarding local merchants. All this notwithstanding, the photographs especially reflect on the fact, the Apollo Theater of Harlem, New York, celebrating its 75th year in 2009, certainly knows how to throw a party, especially for one of its greats which in turn reinforces the cultural and philosophic utility of that institution!#13;#13; #13;#13; To complement the photographs presented in this work, texts praising Mr. Jackson in a positive manner offer different perspectives that constructively chronicle the originality of his life and work as well as seeking to counter negative sentiments expressed regarding the gentleman's personal life. This work of praise highlights some aspects of the mystical, spiritual, divine essence of a man who describes himself as ?a slave to the rhythm? and as ?a perfectionist? who confessed ?I am blessed to be an instrument of nature.' He had an exceptional work ethic. This is manifest and through his extraordinary talents he was able to touch the esoteric metaphysical and spiritual inner core of so many, eschewing a healing potency that speaks to a heavenly endowed mission of human transformation brought about through expressions of love, love, love! In addition, as far as possible, paying attention to the significant body of work he has produced and recounting sentiments expressed by the people, this effort has sought to paint as positive a picture of a man whom Elizabeth Taylor dubbed ?King of Pop, Rock, Soul, Entertainment.' Equally a child star in the public eye just as Michael, she described him as ?highly intelligent, intuitive, understanding, sympathetic and generous? even ?larger than life.' #13;#13; #13;#13; Finally, a bibliography has been appended to encourage further research into the life of this incredible entertainer who knew so many in all walks of life and touched so many more offering sentiments of love, healing and compassion through his magical aura, charitable and humanitarian spirit, and extraordinary creativity that seems timeless. It equally casts a stern and critical view of the role Media has played in hounding Mr. Jackson with a seeming predetermined intent. While the insidious name calling and negativity is renown, an equally good example is also seen for, in the days after his death word circulated on the Internet that Jordan Chandler, the young man who accused Mr. Jackson of child molestation, staining his career and persona, has reportedly confessed that his dad, Evan Chandler, made him falsely swear to those allegations. How sad and even more important, the media has chosen to ignore this revelation unmindful it may make Mr. Jackson rest peacefully knowing the truth has finally and really set him free of that horrible experience; and to those who have so bitterly excoriated him over the years, make them realize how wrong they were in their harsh treatment of this wonderful soul who only had good intentions in his crusade to help and heal mankind, while gushing them with extraordinary joy in music and dance. This issue has been debated unending and no confirmation has been made that Mr. Chandler actually uttered the words attributed to him. Yet, its believed if he did make such a confirmed confession it would probably open any number of possibilities of not just public moral condemnation but also possible legal ramifications. Still, the statue of limitations may have expired regarding the incident and therefore he could not be prosecuted. Nevertheless, conscience is a powerful prosecutor and only time will tell if this whole incident is really true or fabricated. Nonetheless, we should always be mindful of a powerful Michael's saying: ?No one wants to be mortal. Everybody wants immortality. I know the creator will die, but his work will live on.' #13;#13; #13;#13; The Photographs for the most part, speak for themselves, eventhough they carry a caption, for they give the reader an opportunity to observe, ponder, reflect and connect to Michael through their own personal experiences which were shared with and through him. Afterall, hardly anyone over the last decades has not heard and participated in the enjoyment of some song or concert, video, etc., associated with Michael Jackson. #13;#13; #13;#13; The Memorial was designed to celebrate a true Apollo legend, as the theater historian Billy Mitchell indicated, because after his Apollo success Michael was someone who went forth and conquered the world through his work ethic, the sensational gracefulness of his dance routines and the ingenuity of his lyrics and angelic and melodic voice. Putting all of this together, we are convinced there was something special about Michael Jackson, something spiritual, mystical, even magical. He was a sort of mythical figure imbued and guided by divine inspiration and heavenly grace. Deepak Chopra described Michael as ?one of the great iconic artists of our time.' He was an ?artistic genius of immense stature and though not formally trained he read classics and listened to Beethoven and Mozart.' Even further, he added, Michael Jackson ?will be remembered for the agony of what he experienced and the ecstasy he gave people.' Equally his son, Gotham Chopra, a friend of Michael for many years added, ?The same people who scandalized him turned around to praise him. This is part of the mythical process.' That is to say, Michael ascended from mortal to immortal to mistical, mythical stature. #13;#13; #13;#13; All of this is sought to be captured in this volume in Tribute to a man of extraordinary artistry who worked tremendously hard to optimize his talents and become the very best in his profession, setting the bar above the rainbow and daring others to even attempt to reach or scale it. Nevertheless, in process of his unspoken challenge, he dared others to do what he did through love, charity and his trust of humanity, all within the philosophical constructs of the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man.","price":19.95,"pageCount":295,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780615332895-L.jpg","categories":["Rock musicians"]}

He was a man of protean interests and concerns - at once a poet, socialist, Shakespearean scholar, mythographer and Egyptologist. Part of his genius was the ability to look truth in the face and not flinch. Massey did in the cultural domain what modern paleontologists have done in the anthropological: pinpoint Africa as the crucible of humanity's story. In the first volume of Ancient Egypt, Massey was primarily concerned with elaborating how the first humans emergine in Africa created thought. What had been evident to him from the outset was that the myths, rituals and religions of ancient Egypt - or Old Kam - had preserved virtually intact a record of the psychomythic evolution of humanity. In the second volume, Massey examines the celestial phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes. He believed only by understanding this phenomenon was it possible to fathom Nile Valley history. He provides the reader with extensive detail on the interconnection of the two. The last half of the second volume is devoted to the Kamite sources of Christianity. Massey demonstrated the manner in which New Testament Christianity evolved directly out of the Osirian mysteries. Massey pioneered the effort the connect Old Kamite thought to its origin in Africa's antiquity. His conclusions, which are constantly being verified, showed that Kamite thought was the direct progenitor to the philosophy, metaphysics, religion and science that eventually shaped Western cvilization. -- from back cover.","price":59.95,"pageCount":944,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780933121317-L.jpg","categories":["Religion"]}

A Note from Iyanla Vanzant Beloved friend, When this little book was first published many years ago, it became a beacon of light for many people who found themselves time and time again in one valley or another. Valleys are nothing new for any of us. Some of you may be in a valley right now, or, since you never know what’s around the corner, you may be on the brink of tottering into yet another valley. Or maybe you’ve just survived a valley that you swear you’ll never revisit—but guess what? That’s precisely the valley you’ll probably see again. And again. Being in a valley can be a lonely and bewildering experience. This book was written to help you feel less lonely by reminding you that you really aren’t ever alone since God is always by your side, but more important, you are always by your own side. No matter how dire the situation may seem, no matter how dark and bleak the valley may be, you have all you need within you to survive the valley—any valley. Even though you may not know how you got into the valley in the first place, you do know, deep inside yourself, how to get through and out and free. You just need a little faith in yourself and a little guidance to find that faith within yourself. When you are at your wit’s end, take this little book and let it guide you toward the ever-present but often elusive light at the end of the tunnel. Faith in the Valley is designed to help you find the light when you need it most—when you’re in that damn tunnel. When you’re most confused and in the dark and clueless as to how you got there (again!) and when you’re trying to figure out not just how to get out, but stay out. For good. Faith in the Valley has helped so many through so much that we felt it only fitting to issue this lovely gift edition to acknowledge the special place it holds in many hearts. Please share it with a friend who has served as your beacon in the past, or offer it to yourself as a reminder of the strength and wisdom you possess and can offer to others.

This new edition titled Alkaline Plant Based Diet is re-branded to better identify what the book is about. It also includes some minor revisions to content for a more user-friendly experience. An alkaline plant based diet is instrumental in supporting health and vitality, reversing disease, and protecting the earth's ecosystem. It optimally supports a slightly alkaline pH level in the blood, which is the equilibrium point for the health of all the organs in the body. Consuming acidifying meat, dairy, and processed foods causes the body to rely on buffering systems to keep the blood's pH around 7.4. The body then strips alkaline material from bones and tissues to put into the bloodstream when the buffering systems are overwhelmed. This compromises the health of organs and allows for the proliferation of pathogens and toxins. The global assimilation of the Western diet, which is centered on the consumption of meat, dairy, and processed foods, supports industrial processes that compromise the natural life supporting patterns of the earth's ecosystem, and supports the proliferation of disease in the body and in the earth. Diets centered on the consumption of meat, dairy, and processed foods are the catalyst of the inhumane treatment of animals, deforestation, land erosion, depletion of fresh water, and intensified climate change. The mechanisms employed to satisfy the demand for meat, dairy, and processed foods severely compromise the natural patterns that support all life on earth.","price":15.95,"pageCount":148,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781978141933-L.jpg"}

Onyewuenyi in his book: African Belief in Reincarnation: A Philosophical Reappraisal. Reincarnation has a definite meaning in the English language but was used by early European anthropologists as a language of accommodation to cloak their ignorance of the ways African ancestors influence the new-born of their kindred. In addition, the African is a firm believer in an incorporeal form of life beyond. It is the position of the author that Africans cannot/ do not believe in Reincarnation while at the same time recognizing the personal individual existence in the spirit world of the ancestors who are believed to have “reincarnated.”In this book the author has drawn on his unquestionable empirical knowledge of living historical episodes and African bio-cultural phenomena and applied skillfully his philosophical knowledge and wisdom to establish incontrovertibly and convincingly the view that it is wrong and culturally misleading to interpret the relevant phenomena as belief in Reincarnation. He advocates the deletion of the word “Reincarnation” from African cultural anthropology, while suggesting other terminologies which adequately describe the relevant cultural concept of Africans.","price":9.99,"pageCount":50,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781439254349-L.jpg","categories":["Religion"]}
{"isbn":9780982532706,"title":"African Pyramids of Knowledge","author":["Molefi Kete Asante"],"publisher":"Academy","publishedDate":"2015","description":"The Afrocentric method seeks to transform human reality by ushering in a human openness to cultural pluralism that cannot exist without the unlocking of our minds for acceptance of an expansion of consciousness. I seek to overthrow parochialism, provincialism, and narrow Wotanic visions of the world by demonstrating the usefulness of an Afrocentric approach, based on beginning with ancient Kemet, to questions of knowledge. Without a plausible ideology we can never march in the same direction; Afrocentricity is essential for the collective vision. I must alert you to the overpowering value of realizing an Africa truth that has been staring us in the face for thousands of years: the permanence of the pyramids.There is nothing profound in such a pronouncement, there have been similar pronouncements by various other writers, but what is different, I hope, is the identification of the principal cause of the failure in those other formulations. In the West there have been theories and critiques that are fraught with problems whether you call them by the names of existentialism, phenomenology, structuralism, post-colonialism, or deconstruction. What we have come to know is that the proponents of these views have hedged their bets in a European worldview that is moribund when it comes to looking at the outside world. They cannot truly grasp the significance of a revolutionary idea that would challenge the Eurocentric projection of its method as universal. However, the time has come for a total re-evaluation of both intellectual privilege and the assertion of European dominance in knowledge.","price":34.95,"pageCount":298,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780982532706-L.jpg","categories":["Africa"]}

We must destroy it. The time to act is now... With these words begins Gideon Crew's latest, most dangerous, most high-stakes assignment yet. Failure will mean nothing short of the end of humankind on earth. Five years ago, the mysterious and inscrutable head of Effective Engineering Solutions, Eli Glinn, led a mission to recover a gigantic meteorite--the largest ever discovered--from a remote island off the coast of South America. The mission ended in disaster when their ship, the Rolvaag, foundered in a vicious storm in the Antarctic waters and broke apart, sinking-along with its unique cargo-to the ocean floor. One hundred and eight crew members perished, and Eli Glinn was left paralyzed. But this was not all. The tragedy revealed something truly terrifying: the meteorite they tried to retrieve was not, in fact, simply a rock. Instead, it was a complex organism from the deep reaches of space. Now, that organism has implanted itself in the sea bed two miles below the surface-and it is growing. If it is not destroyed, the planet will be doomed. There is only one hope: for Glinn and his team to annihilate it, a task which requires Gideon's expertise with nuclear weapons. But as Gideon and his colleagues soon discover, the \"meteorite\" has a mind of its own-and it has no intention of going quietly...","price":27,"pageCount":384,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781455525867-L.jpg","categories":["Fiction"]}

{"isbn":9781590171356,"title":"The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual","author":["Harold Cruse"],"publisher":"New York Review of Books","publishedDate":"1967","description":"Published in 1967, as the early triumphs of the Civil Rights movement yielded to increasing frustration and violence, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual electrified a generation of activists and intellectuals. The product of a lifetime of struggle and reflection, Cruse's book is a singular amalgam of cultural history, passionate disputation, and deeply considered analysis of the relationship between American blacks and American society. Reviewing black intellectual life from the Harlem Renaissance through the 1960s, Cruse discusses the legacy (and offers memorably acid-edged portraits) of figures such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin, arguing that their work was marked by a failure to understand the specifically American character of racism in the United States. This supplies the background to Cruse's controversial critique of both integrationism and black nationalism and to his claim that black Americans will only assume a just place within American life when they develop their own distinctive centers of cultural and economic influence. For Cruse's most important accomplishment may well be his rejection of the clich?s of the melting pot in favor of a vision of Americanness as an arena of necessary and vital contention, an open and ongoing struggle.","price":24.95,"pageCount":594,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781590171356-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

A friend of luminaries including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Medgar Evers, and the forebear of today’s popular black comics, including Larry Wilmore, W. Kamau Bell, Damon Young, and Trevor Noah, Dick Gregory was a provocative and incisive cultural force for more than fifty years. As an entertainer, he always kept it indisputably real about race issues in America, fearlessly lacing laughter with hard truths. As a leading activist against injustice, he marched at Selma during the Civil Rights movement, organized student rallies to protest the Vietnam War; sat in at rallies for Native American and feminist rights; fought apartheid in South Africa; and participated in hunger strikes in support of Black Lives Matter. In this collection of thoughtful, provocative essays, Gregory charts the complex and often obscured history of the African American experience. In his unapologetically candid voice, he moves from African ancestry and surviving the Middle Passage to the creation of the Jheri Curl, the enjoyment of bacon and everything pig, the headline-making shootings of black men, and the Black Lives Matter movement. A captivating journey through time, Defining Moments in Black History explores historical movements such as The Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance, as well as cultural touchstones such as Sidney Poitier winning the Best Actor Oscar for Lilies in the Field and Billie Holiday releasing Strange Fruit. An engaging look at black life that offers insightful commentary on the intricate history of the African American people, Defining Moments in Black History is an essential, no-holds-bar history lesson that will provoke, enlighten, and entertain.","price":24.99,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780062448699-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Instead it is a collection of his teachings--what he actually said. These 114 logia, or sayings, were collected by Judas Didymus Thomas, whom some claim to be Jesus's closest disciple. No sooner was this gospel uncovered from the sands of Upper Egypt than scholars and theologians began to bury it anew in a host of conflicting interpretations and polemics. While some say it is a hodgepodge from the canonical gospels, for others it is the source text from which all the gospel writers drew their material and inspiration. In this new translation of the Gospel of Thomas, Jean-Yves Leloup shows that the Jesus recorded by the \"infinitely skeptical and infinitely believing\" Thomas has much in common with gnostics of non-dualistic schools. Like them, Jesus preaches the coming of a new man, the genesis of the man of knowledge. In this gospel, Jesus describes a journey from limited to unlimited consciousness. The Jesus of Thomas invites us to drink deeply from the well of knowledge that lies within, not so that we may become good Christians but so we may attain the self-knowledge that will make each of us, too, a Christ.","price":14.95,"pageCount":240,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594770463-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

But when her family moved to New York during the radical sixties, she became intoxicated by the promise of social change. By the time she turned twenty-one, Alice had a new name -- Afeni Shakur, derived from the Yoruba term for \"lover of people\" -- and a new vision for the future. The rest is history. In 1969, Afeni was arrested along with other members of the Black Panther party on 189 felony charges that included 30 counts of conspiracy. Though she was eventually acquitted of the charges, Afeni spent eleven months in jail before being released. Once on bail, she became pregnant with a son: Tupac Amaru Shakur, a rap megastar until his tragic death in 1996. In this searing work, renowned actress and Afeni's trusted friend Jasmine Guy reveals the evolution of a woman through a series of intimate conversations on themes such as love, death, race, drugs, politics, music, and of course her son. Filled with startling revelations and heartbreaking truths, Afeni's memoir is a powerful testament to the human spirit and the perseverance of the African American people.","price":15,"pageCount":240,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780743470544-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

{"isbn":9780399588174,"title":"Born a Crime","author":["Trevor Noah"],"publisher":"Spiegel & Grau","publishedDate":"2016-11-15","description":"The compelling, inspiring, and comically sublime story of one man's coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother--his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty.

Believed to be the tomb of an Egyptian king, even though no remains have ever been found, its construction date of roughly 2550 BCE is tied to only one piece of evidence: the crudely painted marks within the pyramid’s hidden chambers that refer to the 4th Dynasty king Khufu, discovered in 1837 by Colonel Howard Vyse and his team. Using evidence from the time of the discovery of these “quarry marks”--including surveys, facsimile drawings and Vyse’s private field notes--along with high definition photos of the actual marks, Scott Creighton reveals how and why the marks were faked. He investigates the anomalous and contradictory orthography of the quarry marks through more than 75 photos and illustrations, showing how they radically depart from the established canon of quarry marks from this period. He explains how the orientation of the Khufu cartouche contradicts ancient Egyptian writing convention and how one of the signs is from a later period. Analyzing Vyse’s private diary, he reveals Vyse’s forgery instructions to his two assistants, Raven and Hill, and what the anachronistic sign should have been. He examines recent chemical analysis of the marks along with the eye-witness testimony of Humphries Brewer, who worked with Vyse at Giza in 1837 and saw forgery take place. Exploring Vyse’s background, including his electoral fraud to become a member of the British Parliament, he explains why he was driven to perpetrate a fraud inside the Great Pyramid. Proving Zecharia Sitchin’s claim that the quarry marks are forgeries and removing the only physical evidence that dates the Great Pyramid’s construction to the reign of Khufu, Creighton’s study strikes down one of the most fundamental assertions of orthodox Egyptologists and reopens long-standing questions about the Great Pyramid’s true age, who really built it, and why.","price":16,"pageCount":224,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591437895-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

In this installment, Mitchell is teaching how in America, europeans have stolen the Black Talented Tenth and done so by using a system of self hate which infects the minds of Africans in America causing a great divide. Mitchell is exposing us all to this system which is a more advanced and subtle version of willie lynchism. Whereas during slavery they verbalized \"light skin slaves in the house, dark skin slaves in the field,\" the system of self hate achieves the same goals covertly. This time it wasn't about separating us by skin color but separating us by talent and potential. They lure the best Africans in America to assimilate into white American culture for the sole purpose of keeping our best from helping the rest. In this book, Mitchell shows how this system of self hate operates and how they get us to buy in to hating and dividing ourselves, with the hope that our Talented Tenth see how they've been stolen, disassociate from the white world and dedicate themselves to building for their race.","price":25,"pageCount":144,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781539478829-L.jpg","categories":["African Americans"]}

Instead it is a collection of his teachings--what he actually said. These 114 logia, or sayings, were collected by Judas Didymus Thomas, whom some claim to be Jesus's closest disciple. No sooner was this gospel uncovered from the sands of Upper Egypt than scholars and theologians began to bury it anew in a host of conflicting interpretations and polemics. While some say it is a hodgepodge from the canonical gospels, for others it is the source text from which all the gospel writers drew their material and inspiration. In this new translation of the Gospel of Thomas, Jean-Yves Leloup shows that the Jesus recorded by the \"infinitely skeptical and infinitely believing\" Thomas has much in common with gnostics of non-dualistic schools. Like them, Jesus preaches the coming of a new man, the genesis of the man of knowledge. In this gospel, Jesus describes a journey from limited to unlimited consciousness. The Jesus of Thomas invites us to drink deeply from the well of knowledge that lies within, not so that we may become good Christians but so we may attain the self-knowledge that will make each of us, too, a Christ.","price":14.95,"pageCount":240,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594770463-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

This is the first book to make this ancient knowledge available to the West. The foundation of healing love is the cultivation, transformation, and circulation of sexual energy, known as jing. Jing energy is creative, generative energy that is vital for the development of chi (vital life-force energy) and shen (spiritual energy), which enables higher practices of spiritual development. Jing is produced in the sexual organs, and it is energy women lose continually through menstruation and child bearing. Mantak Chia teaches powerful techniques developed by Taoist masters for the conservation of jing and how it is used to revitalize women's physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Among the many benefits conferred by these practices are a reduction in the discomfort caused by menstruation and the ability to attain full-body orgasm.","price":16.95,"pageCount":288,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594770685-L.jpg","categories":["Health & Fitness"]}

Book Publishing","publishedDate":"2006-01-01","description":"3.THE KEMETIC DIET: GUIDE TO HEALTH, DIET AND FASTING Health issues have always been important to human beings since the beginning of time. The earliest records of history show that the art of healing was held in high esteem since the time of Ancient Egypt. In the early 20th century, medical doctors had almost attained the status of sainthood by the promotion of the idea that they alone were \"scientists\" while other healing modalities and traditional healers who did not follow the \"scientific method' were nothing but superstitious, ignorant charlatans who at best would take the money of their clients and at worst kill them with the unscientific \"snake oils\" and \"irrational theories.\" In the late 20th century, the failure of the modern medical establishment's ability to lead the general public to good health, promoted the move by many in society towards \"alternative medicine.\" Alternative medicine disciplines are those healing modalities which do not adhere to the philosophy of allopathic medicine. Allopathic medicine is what medical doctors practice by an large. It is the theory that disease is caused by agencies outside the body such as bacteria, viruses or physical means which affect the body. These can therefore be treated by medicines and therapies The natural healing method began in the absence of extensive technologies with the idea that all the answers for health may be found in nature or rather, the deviation from nature.

One of his first cases was that of Walter McMillian, a young man who was sentenced to die for a notorious murder he insisted he didn't commit. The case drew Bryan into a tangle of conspiracy, political machination, and legal brinksmanship--and transformed his understanding of mercy and justice forever. Just Mercy is at once an unforgettable account of an idealistic, gifted young lawyer's coming of age, a moving window into the lives of those he has defended, and an inspiring argument for compassion in the pursuit of true justice. Praise for Just Mercy \"Every bit as moving as To Kill a Mockingbird, and in some ways more so . . . a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.\"--David Cole, The New York Review of Books \"Searing, moving . . . Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America's Mandela.\"--Nicholas Kristof, The New York Times \"You don't have to read too long to start cheering for this man. . . .

Though larger than life, Atticus exists only in fiction.

Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend. None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy. Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she��s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others. By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, The Last Black Unicorn shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.","price":26,"pageCount":288,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781501181825-L.jpg","categories":["Humor"]}

Convincing others—and often yourself—that you possess the answers and are capable of world-affecting change requires confidence, insight, and sheer bravado. Minority Leader is the handbook for outsiders, written with the awareness of the experiences and challenges that hinder anyone who exists beyond the structure of traditional white male power—women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and millennials ready to make a difference. In Minority Leader, Stacey Abrams argues that knowing your own passion is the key to success, regardless of the scale or target. From launching a company, to starting a day care center for homeless teen moms, to running a successful political campaign, finding what you want to fight for is as critical as knowing how to turn thought into action. Stacey uses her experience and hard-won insights to break down how ambition, fear, money, and failure function in leadership, while offering personal stories that illuminate practical strategies. Stacey includes exercises to help you hone your skills and realize your aspirations. She discusses candidly what she has learned over the course of her impressive career: that differences in race, gender, and class are surmountable. With direction and dedication, being in the minority actually provides unique and vital strength, which we can employ to rise to the top and make real change.","price":17,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781250214805-L.jpg","categories":["Self-Help"]}
{"isbn":9780935028041,"title":"Land Justice","author":["Justine M. Williams","Eric Holt-Giménez"],"publisher":"Food First Books","publishedDate":"2017","description":"In recent decades, the various strands of the food movement have made enormous strides in calling attention the many shortcomings and injustices of our food and agricultural system. Farmers, activists, scholars, and everyday citizens have also worked creatively to rebuild local food economies, advocate for food justice, and promote more sustainable, agroecological farming practices. However, the movement for fairer, healthier, and more autonomous food is continually blocked by one obstacle: land access. As long as land remains unaffordable and inaccessible to most people, we cannot truly transform the food system. The term land-grabbing is most commonly used to refer to the large-scale acquisition of agricultural land in Asian, African, or Latin American countries by foreign investors. However, land has and continues to be \"grabbed\" in North America, as well, through discrimination, real estate speculation, gentrification, financialization, extractive energy production, and tourism. This edited volume, with chapters from a wide range of activists and scholars, explores the history of land theft, dispossession, and consolidation in the United States. It also looks at alternative ways forward toward democratized, land justice, based on redistributive policies and cooperative ownership models. With prefaces from leaders in the food justice and family farming movements, the book opens with a look at the legacies of white-settler colonialism in the southwestern United States. From there, it moves into a collectively-authored section on Black Agrarianism, which details the long history of land dispossession among Black farmers in the southeastern US, as well as the creative acts of resistance they have used to acquire land and collectively farm it. The next section, on gender, explores structural and cultural discrimination against women landowners in the Midwest and also role of \"womanism\" in land-based struggles. Next, a section on the cross-border implications of land enclosures and consolidations includes a consideration of what land justice could mean for farm workers in the US, followed by an essay on the challenges facing young and aspiring farmers. Finally, the book explores the urban dimensions of land justice and their implications for locally-autonomous food systems, and lessons from previous struggles for democratized land access. Ultimately, the book makes the case that to move forward to a more equitable, just, sustainable, and sovereign agriculture system, the various strands of the food movement must come together for land justice.","price":24.95,"pageCount":283,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780935028041-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Based on interviews with over fifty people -- both white and black -- these stories deliver a personal and powerful message about resilience and resistance in the face of oppression in the Jim Crow South. The housekeepers, caretakers, sharecroppers, and cooks who share their experiences in The Maid Narratives ultimately moved away during the Great Migration. Their perspectives as servants who left for better opportunities outside of the South offer an original telling of physical and psychological survival in a racially oppressive caste system: Vinella Byrd, for instance, from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, recalls how a farmer she worked for would not allow her to clean her hands in the family's wash pan. These narratives are complemented by the voices of white women, such as Flora Templeton Stuart, from New Orleans, who remembers her maid fondly but realizes that she knew little about her life. Like Stuart, many of the white narrators remain troubled by the racial norms of the time. Viewed as a whole, the book presents varied, rich, and detailed accounts, often tragic, and sometimes humorous. The Maid Narratives reveals, across racial lines, shared hardships, strong emotional ties, and inspiring strength.","price":16.95,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780807162361-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

These American poems are both elegy and jive, joke and declaration, songs of congregation and self-conception. They connect themes of loneliness, displacement, grief, ancestral trauma, and objectification, while exploring and troubling tropes and stereotypes of Black Americans. Focused primarily on depictions of Black womanhood alongside personal narratives, the collection tackles interior and exterior politics--of both the body and society, of both the individual and the collective experience. In Magical Negro, Parker creates a space of witness, of airing grievances, of pointing out patterns. In these poems are living documents, pleas, latent traumas, inside jokes, and unspoken anxieties situated as firmly in the past as in the present--timeless Black melancholies and triumphs.","price":15.95,"pageCount":112,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781947793187-L.jpg","categories":["Poetry"]}

As the Civil Rights movement begins to reach the black enclave of Frenchtown in segregated Tallahassee, Elwood Curtis takes the words of Dr. Martin Luther King to heart: He is \"as good as anyone.\" Abandoned by his parents, but kept on the straight and narrow by his grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South of the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called the Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides \"physical, intellectual and moral training\" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become \"honorable and honest men.\" In reality, the Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear \"out back.\" Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold onto Dr. King's ringing assertion \"Throw us in jail and we will still love you.\" His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked, and that the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. The tension between Elwood's ideals and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys' fates will be determined by what they endured at the Nickel Academy. Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative that showcases a great American novelist writing at the height of his powers.","price":24.95,"pageCount":224,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780385537070-L.jpg","categories":["Fiction"]}

When Darnell Moore was fourteen years old, three boys from his neighborhood tried to set him on fire. They cornered him while he was walking home from school, harassed him because they assumed he was gay, and poured a jug of gasoline on him. He escaped, but just barely. It wasn't the last time he would face death. Three decades later, Moore is an award-winning writer and activist, a leader in the Movement for Black Lives, and a tireless advocate for justice and liberation. In No Ashes in the Fire, he sets out to understand how that scared, bullied teenager not only survived, but found his calling. Moore traces his life from his childhood in Camden, New Jersey, a city scarred by uprisings and repression; to his search for intimacy in the gay neighborhoods of Philadelphia; and, finally, to the movements in Newark, Brooklyn, and Ferguson where he could fight for those who, like him, survive on society's edges. No Ashes in the Fire is a story of beauty and hope - and an honest reckoning with family, with place, and with what it means to be free.","price":26,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781568589480-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

It examines an extended white attempt to pattern politics and education in colonial Africa upon the example of the U.S. South. This export of United States race relations to Africa was resisted by Black intellectuals in the United States and many of the early nationalists in Africa.

Found threaded through our dreams, these bloodlines reveal the forces manifesting in this life, and, taken together, they shape individuality as well as destiny within the reincarnation cycle. Though a wealth of past life related material regularly surfaces in dreams, until now dreamwork has been largely ignored as a therapy for successfully integrating past life experiences. Using the results of 27 years of personal and professional work, Lucas explains that past life memories help us work out karma on the macro level and trauma on a micro level. She distinguishes three types of past life dreams--classic, informatory, and hybrid--and demonstrates how to distinguish these from other dreams. Her dramatic case studies illustrate the effectiveness of dream therapy in recognizing and integrating the resonant and recurrent circumstances and ethical dilemmas that are played out in the subconscious mind. These psychologically revealing stories bear witness to how individuals are made whole through the integration of common strands of forgotten or repressed past lives. Lucas shows that the integration of past lives enriches the conscious self and also promotes universal tolerance through an understanding of the patterns of our psychic soul inheritance.","price":16,"pageCount":288,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591430759-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

Common believes that the phrase “let love have the last word” is not just a declaration; it is a statement of purpose, a daily promise. Love is the most powerful force on the planet and ultimately, the way you love determines who you are and how you experience life. Touching on God, self-love, partners, children, family, and community, Common explores the core tenets of love to help others understand what it means to receive and, most important, to give love. He moves from the personal—writing about his daughter, to whom he wants to be a better father—to the universal, where he observes that our society has become fractured under issues of race and politics. He knows there's no quick remedy for all of the hurt in the world, but love—for yourself and for others—is where the healing begins. Courageous, insightful, brave, and characteristically authentic, Let Love Have the Last Word shares Common’s own unique and personal stories of the people and experiences that have led to a greater understanding of love and all it has to offer. It is a powerful call to action for a new generation of open hearts and minds, one that is sure to resonate for years to come.","price":26,"pageCount":224,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781501133152-L.jpg","categories":["Self-Help"]}

It has survived the harsh climate of Egypt for thousands of years and will remain long after our own civilization is gone. According to orthodox Egyptology, the Sphinx was built around 2500 BCE as a memorial to the pharaoh Khafre. Yet this “fact” has scant to no supportive evidence. When was the Sphinx really built and, most importantly, why? In this provocative collaboration from two Egyptology outsiders, Robert M. Schoch, Ph.D., and Robert Bauval combine their decades of research to show how the Sphinx is thousands of years older than the conventional Egyptological timeline and was built by a long forgotten pre-Pharaonic civilization. They examine the known history of the Sphinx, contrasting what Egyptologists claim with prominent historical accounts and new research, including updates to Schoch’s geological water weathering research and reanalysis of seismic studies. Building on Bauval’s Orion Correlation Theory, they investigate the archaeoastronomical alignments of the monuments of the Giza Plateau and reveal how the pyramids and Sphinx were built to align with the constellations of Orion and Leo. Analyzing the evidence for a significantly older construction phase at Giza and the restoration and recarving of the Sphinx during the Old Kingdom era, they assert that the Sphinx was first built by an advanced pre-Pharaonic civilization that existed circa 12,000 years ago on the Giza Plateau, contemporaneous with the sophisticated Göbekli Tepe complex. The authors examine how the monuments at Giza memorialize Zep Tepi, the Golden Age of legend shown here to be an actual historical time period from roughly 10,500 BCE through 9700 BCE. Moving us closer to an understanding of the true age and purpose of the Great Sphinx, Schoch and Bauval provide evidence of an early high civilization witnessed by the Great Sphinx before the end of the last ice age.","price":24.95,"pageCount":528,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781620555255-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

Curry, Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church So often we think of the Christian faith as an obligation or as a set of beliefs that we must hold. With this outlook, we can lose sight of what is most important: the invitation to experience a loving, personal relationship with God. It’s a relationship we can trust, where we can find refuge and solid ground upon which to stand. The Way of Love set forth by the Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop Michael Bruce Curry is the journey of a lifetime. It’s a way of knowing God, receiving and sharing Jesus’ love, and being a blessing to the world. Mariann Edgar Budde shares her thoughts on how the reader can come to know--to receive--Jesus more deeply in practicing the Way of Love. Through the seven practices that have been put before us: to turn, to learn, to pray and to worship, to bless, to go, and to rest, she will share biblical stories, wisdom from the Christian tradition, and her own personal stories of spiritual growth.","price":15,"pageCount":128,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781640652408-L.jpg","categories":["Religion"]}

In Rumor, Repression, and Racial Politics, Derek Musgrove pushes much further, presenting a powerful new historical framework for understanding race and politics between 1965 and 1996. He argues that in order to make sense of this recent period, we need to examine the harassment of black elected officials - the ways black politicians were denied access to seats they'd won in elections or, after taking office, were targeted in corruption probes. Musgrove's aim is not to evaluate whether individual allegations of corruption had merit, but to establish what the pervasive harassment of black politicians has meant, politically and culturally, over the course of recent American history. It's a story that takes him from California to Michigan to Alabama, and along the way covers a fascinating range of topics: Watergate, the surveillance state, the power of conspiracy theories, the plunge in voter turnout, and even the strange political campaigns of Lyndon LaRouche\"--Provided by publisher.","price":24.95,"pageCount":296,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780820341217-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Scranton also pointed to the close resemblance between the keywords and component elements of Dogon cosmology and those of ancient Egypt, and the implication that ancient cosmology may also be about actual science. Sacred Symbols of the Dogon uses these parallels as the starting point for a new interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphic language. By substituting Dogon cosmological drawings for equivalent glyph-shapes in Egyptian words, a new way of reading and interpreting the Egyptian hieroglyphs emerges. Scranton shows how each hieroglyph constitutes an entire concept, and that their meanings are scientific in nature. Using the Dogon symbols as a “Rosetta stone,” he reveals references within the ancient Egyptian language that define the full range of scientific components of matter: from massless waves to the completed atom, even suggesting direct correlations to a fully realized unified field theory.","price":18.95,"pageCount":272,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594771347-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

He spoke with teachers, principals, superintendents, and, most important, children. What he found was devastating. Not only were schools for rich and poor blatantly unequal, the gulf between the two extremes was widening—and it has widened since. The urban schools he visited were overcrowded and understaffed, and lacked the basic elements of learning—including books and, all too often, classrooms for the students. In Savage Inequalities, Kozol delivers a searing examination of the extremes of wealth and poverty and calls into question the reality of equal opportunity in our nation's schools.","price":15,"pageCount":318,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780770435684-L.jpg","categories":["Education"]}

Evidence indicates President Barack Obama has been tremendously successful and effective by objective measures. On economic indicators alone, he is credited with the longest streak of job growth in U.S. history, a two-thirds reduction in the federal budget deficit, and the rebounding of the stock market to record highs following the record lows of the recession under his predecessor. His victories have come against a backdrop of criticism and sometimes open defiance from conservatives, lack of cooperation in Congress, and racially tinged commentary in traditional and social media. Through it all, the President who campaigned on a slogan of 'Yes, We Can!' has persevered in his determination to make a difference and left an indelible mark on American politics and the world.

She enlightened him on the sacred and secret science of sex. This book is the result of the author's encounters with her. In ancient Afrika, there was no separation from the word God and nature. To know God meant to understand how nature operates. Energy can be divided into masculine and feminine principles. Once we understand how these energies work in nature, we can fully overstand the roles men and women play as the foundation that holds the Universe in a delicate balance. This book was written based on anient Kemetic science for the upliftment of the Black race. We are being ushered into a new Age of consciousness where the feminine spirit will rule for the next 2,000 years. If one cannot make the transition into this higher consciousness, one will be left behind.

The most powerful reflex points on the body are on the sexual organs. While the practice of reflexology is normally associated with massage of the feet, in Sexual Reflexology Mantak Chia gives applications for using the sexual reflex points in lovemaking, transforming sexual intercourse into a form of ecstatic acupressure. By combining the classic Taoist sexual texts with modern reflexology theory, the author provides a unique opportunity for couples to practice sexual intimacy as an act of healing. Mantak Chia shows how to evaluate a person's sexual energy potential as well as how the size and shape of the sexual organs determine a couple's compatibility. In addition to the specific ecstatic acupressure exercise instructions, he provides thoughtful commentary on ancient Taoist practices that reveal how we can all use our sexual essence to create healthy and loving relationships.","price":18,"pageCount":208,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780892810888-L.jpg","categories":["Health & Fitness"]}

During the Civil War, she worked as a nurse for wounded soldiers, a caretaker of refugee slaves, and a spy and scout for Union forces. Late in life she was active in the fight for women's suffrage. Mythologized by many biographers and historians, Tubman was an ordinary but complex woman - tiny but strong, guided by her belief in God and religious visions, yet a tough, savvy leader who the radical abolitionist John Brown admired as \"the General.\" In 2016, it was announced that Tubman would become the first woman to appear on US currency \"the $20 bill\" in over a century. Drawing on the latest historical research, Harriet Tubman For Beginners portrays a woman who resisted and transcended slavery and fought injustice her entire life. Beyond legend, she made her mark on history by defending core American principles - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - for others.","price":15.95,"pageCount":176,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781939994721-L.jpg","categories":["African American abolitionists"]}

In his insightful study, Janheinz Jahn surveys the whole range of traditional and modern African thought expressed in religion, language, philosophy, literature, art, music and dance. He demonstrates that African culture, far from being doomed to destruction or homogenization under the onslaught of the West, is evolving into a rich and independent civilization that is capable of incorporating those elements of the West that do not threaten its basic values. Muntu (the Bantu word for “human”) presents an invaluable insight into the foundations of the unique and vital tapestry of cultures that compromise Africa today.","price":16,"pageCount":267,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780802132086-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Pete Souza served as Chief Official White House Photographer for President Obama's full two terms. He was with the President during more crucial moments than anyone else--and he photographed them all. Souza took nearly two million photographs of President Obama, capturing moments both highly classified and disarmingly candid. Obama: An Intimate Portrait reproduces Souza's most iconic photographs in exquisite detail, more than three hundred in all. Some have never been published. These photographs document the most consequential hours of the Presidency--including the historic image of President Obama and his advisors in the Situation Room during the bin Laden mission--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his encounters with children, interactions with world leaders and cultural figures, and more. Souza's photographs, with the behind-the-scenes captions and stories that accompany them, communicate the pace and power of our nation's highest office. They also reveal the spirit of the extraordinary man who became our President. We see President Obama lead our nation through monumental challenges, comfort us in calamity and loss, share in hard-won victories, and set a singular example to \"be kind and be useful,\" as he would instruct his daughters. The result is a portrait of exceptional intimacy and a stunning record of a landmark era in American history.","price":55,"pageCount":352,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780316512589-L.jpg","categories":["Photography"]}

Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder.\"\" In Perkins''s case the tool was debt - --convincing strategically important countries to borrow huge amounts of money for enormous \"\"development\" \" projects that served the very rich while driving the country deeper into poverty and debt. And once indebted, these countries could be controlled. In this latest edition, Perkins provides revealing new details about how he and others did their work. But more importantly, in an explosive new section he describes how the EHM tools are being used around the world more widely than ever-- - even in the U. S. itself. The cancer has metastasized, yet most people still aren''t aware of it. Fear and debt drive the EHM system. We are hammered with messages that terrify us into believing that we must pay any price, assume any debt, to stop the enemies who, we are told, lurk at our doorsteps. The EHM system - --employing false economics, bribes, surveillance, deception, debt, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power - --has become the dominant system of economics, government, and society today. It has created what Perkins calls a \"\"Death Economy.\"\" But Perkins offers hope: he concludes with dozens of specific, concrete suggestions for actions all of us can take to wrest control of our world away from the economic hit men, and help give birth to a Life Economy.","price":17.95,"pageCount":366,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781626566743-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

J. Walker—the legendary African American entrepreneur and philanthropist—by her great-great-granddaughter, A'Lelia Bundles. The daughter of slaves, Madam C. J. Walker was orphaned at seven, married at fourteen and widowed at twenty. She spent the better part of the next two decades laboring as a washerwoman for $1.50 a week. Then—with the discovery of a revolutionary hair care formula for black women—everything changed. By her death in 1919, Walker managed to overcome astonishing odds: building a storied beauty empire from the ground up, amassing wealth unprecedented among black women and devoting her life to philanthropy and social activism. Along the way, she formed friendships with great early-twentieth-century political figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington. On Her Own Ground is not only the first comprehensive biography of one of recent history's most amazing entrepreneurs and philanthropists, it is about a woman who is truly an African American icon. Drawn from more than two decades of exhaustive research, the book is enriched by the author's exclusive access to personal letters, records and never-before-seen photographs from the family collection. Bundles also showcases Walker's complex relationship with her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, a celebrated hostess of the Harlem Renaissance and renowned friend to both Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. In chapters such as “Freedom Baby,” “Motherless Child,” “Bold Moves” and “Black Metropolis,” Bundles traces her ancestor's improbable rise to the top of an international hair care empire that would be run by four generations of Walker women until its sale in 1985. Along the way, On Her Own Ground reveals surprising insights, tells fascinating stories and dispels many misconceptions.","price":19,"pageCount":416,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780743431729-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

Hawk reveals how you can consciously influence your DNA and re-encode it to improve your health and alter your genetic destiny. Sharing the discoveries that enabled her to successfully heal from her cancer, tumors, toxicity, and inflammatory-related conditions, the author explains how genes are not solely responsible for creating disease. She shows how human physiology interacts with the quantum energies of our external and personal environments and how the resulting information triggers the development and persistence of disease and chronic conditions. We each inherit susceptibilities, but it is our unique experience of these environmental factors, as well as our beliefs, thoughts, and emotions, that alter the way our genes are expressed. Detailing how our DNA is both quantum-energetic and biological-chemical, Hawk explains how your environment and your consciousness influence your quantum DNA, which in turn interacts with your biological DNA. By working directly with energetic information that affects how your quantum and biological DNA communicate, you can alter the expression of your genes by re-encoding the gene sequences on your physical DNA, erasing the imprint of illness and enabling your body to remember how to function properly. Hawk explores consciousness tools and mind-body techniques to re-encode your DNA, such as sound and breathing work, DNA marker removal, recalibration of Akashic information, and cellular communication exercises that readers can apply to their own healing journeys.","price":16,"pageCount":240,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591432876-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

Mass incarceration and aggressive police tactics—and their impact on people of color—are feeding outrage and a consensus that something must be done. But what if we only know half the story? In Locking Up Our Own, the Yale legal scholar and former public defender James Forman Jr. weighs the tragic role that some African Americans themselves played in escalating the war on crime. As Forman shows, the first substantial cohort of black mayors, judges, and police chiefs took office around the country amid a surge in crime. Many came to believe that tough measures—such as stringent drug and gun laws and “pretext traffic stops” in poor African American neighborhoods—were needed to secure a stable future for black communities. Some politicians and activists saw criminals as a “cancer” that had to be cut away from the rest of black America. Others supported harsh measures more reluctantly, believing they had no other choice in the face of a public safety emergency. Drawing on his experience as a public defender and focusing on Washington, D.C., Forman writes with compassion for individuals trapped in terrible dilemmas—from the young men and women he defended to officials struggling to cope with an impossible situation. The result is an original view of our justice system as well as a moving portrait of the human beings caught in its coils.","price":27,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780374189976-L.jpg","categories":["Political Science"]}

It has since become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time... translated into dozens of languages and sold around the world.

In his previous works Sitchin compiled the complete story of the Anunnaki’s impact on human civilization from fragments scattered throughout Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Egyptian, Canaanite, and Hebrew sources. Missing from these accounts, however, was the perspective of the Anunnaki themselves. What was life like on their own planet? What motives propelled them to settle on Earth--and what drove them from their new home? Convinced of the existence of a lost book that held the answers to these questions, the author began his search for evidence. Through exhaustive research of primary sources, he has here re-created tales as the memoirs of Enki, the leader of these first “astronauts.” What takes shape is the story of a world of mounting tensions, deep rivalries, and sophisticated scientific knowledge that is only today being confirmed. An epic tale of gods and men unfolds, challenging every assumption we hold about our past and our future.","price":16,"pageCount":336,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781591430377-L.jpg","categories":["Fiction"]}

Yet, perhaps only rarely do they grasp the implications of the theology embedded in these practices or in the liturgies of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, which has shaped Episcopalians in this country with its emphasis on baptismal spirituality and the centrality of the Eucharist. Julia Gatta wants to change that with her new book, Life in Christ. Applying her years of experience as pastor and spiritual director combined with her study of the spiritual wisdom of the past, she explores common Christian practices and their underlying theology through an Episcopal lens. In the tradition of Esther de Waal, Martin Smith, and Martin Thornton, with particular reference to scripture, The Book of Common Prayer, and the wisdom of the Christian spiritual tradition, she illuminates methods readers may already be practicing and provides insight and guidance to ones that may be new to them.","price":18,"pageCount":224,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780819233127-L.jpg","categories":["Religion"]}

During this living resurrection, they experienced a transformative spiritual awakening that revealed the nature of reality and the purpose of the soul, described as “rising from the dead.” Exploring the practice of living resurrection in ancient Egyptian, Phoenician, Greek, Persian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Celtic, and Native American traditions, Freddy Silva explains how resurrection was never meant for the dead, but for the living--a fact supported by the suppressed Gnostic Gospel of Philip: “Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will receive nothing.” He reveals how these practices were not only common in the ancient world but also shared similar facets in each tradition: initiates were led through a series of challenging ordeals, retreated for a three-day period into a cave or restricted room, often called a “bridal chamber,” and while out-of-body, became fully conscious of travels in the Otherworld. Upon returning to the body, they were led by priests or priestesses to witness the rising of Sirius or the Equinox sunrise. Silva describes some of the secret chambers around the world where the ritual was performed, including the so-called tomb of Thutmosis III in Egypt, which featured an empty sarcophagus and detailed instructions for the living on how to enter the Otherworld and return alive. He reveals why esoteric and Gnostic sects claimed that the literal resurrection of Jesus promoted by the Church was a fraud and how the Church branded all living resurrection practices as a heresy, relentlessly persecuting the Gnostics to suppress knowledge of this self-empowering experience. He shows how the Knights Templar revived these concepts and how they survive to this day within Freemasonry. Exploring the hidden art of living resurrection, Silva shows how this personal experience of the Divine opened the path to self-empowerment and higher consciousness, leading initiates such as Plato to describe it as the pinnacle of spiritual development.","price":18.95,"pageCount":288,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781620556368-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

In the pages of Lost Tribes and Promised Lands, celebrated historian and cultural critic Ronald Sanders offers a compelling and ideology-shattering history of racial prejudice and myth as shaped by political, religious, and economic forces from the 14th Century to the present day. Written with clear-eyed vigor, Sanders draws on a broad history of art, psychology, politics, and religion to inform his striking and soundly-reasoned assertions. \"Lost Tribes and Promised Lands\" nimbly zig-zags through space and time, doggedly chipping away at the myopic history of discovery and righteous conquest that has been reiterated for decades by the same ideological forces responsible for centuries of mythological prejudice and racial strife. Placing 14th Century Spanish intolerance (specifically anti-Semitism) as the origins of American racism toward African and Native Americans, Sanders elegantly weaves complex threads of colonial economics, religious exceptionalism, and xenophobia into a heady and often-infuriating thesis on the history of racism. Finally back in print and widely available to the general public, \"Lost Tribes and Promised Lands\" is a gripping and hegemony-exploding treatise on the history of race in the New World.","price":40,"pageCount":456,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781626542778-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

To the Mason the Bible is the guide of faith for it gives us GodOs holy instructions. It also has within it a secret knowledge that many of our traditional churches refused to tap into. Therefore this knowledge is esoteric in nature and this is what masonry thrives on. This book will examine not only the contributions by ancient Kemet (Egypt) To religion but the entire content of Africa which has a conglomerate of religions all are pointing to one divine creator.

Teresa N. Washington eschews popular culture’s pimp myths and thug sagas and traces the Africana man’s power, creativity, and consciousness to his inherent divinity. Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence takes the reader to the source of power with an analysis of African Divinities and divine technologies. Washington explores the permanence and proliferation of African Gods from oppressive plantations to the empowering proclamations of such leaders as W. D. Fard, Marcus Garvey, Father Divine, and Allah, the Father. Washington analyzes the summonses to and from the Gods that resonate in the music of such artists as Erykah Badu, The RZA, Sun Ra, X Clan, and Rakim. Using literary analysis as a prism to display the diversity of Africana divinity, Washington reveals the literature of such writers as August Wilson, Walter Mosley, Toni Morrison, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and Ishmael Reed to be three-way mirrors that eternally reflect and project the Gods, their myriad powers, and their weighty responsibilities. Manifestations of Masculine Magnificence will prove indispensable to independent scholars as well as scholars of Comparative Literature, Hip Hop Studies, Gender Studies, Africana Studies, Literary Criticism, and Religious Studies.","price":42.99,"pageCount":416,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780991073009-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Hotep deals with the commemoration of the ancestors, some of whom are great figures that stand out in history, such as Imhotep, the world's first known multigenius and true father of medicine; Ptahhotep, the author or the world's oldest book of instruction; Neithhotep, the First Dynasty queen and wife of Pharoah Mena; and Amenhotep, who designed the Ipet-Isut Temple in the west. All the major Western religions teach that man wound up being cast out of his heavenly abode due to woman's ungodly act of enticing him to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thereby incurring the wrath of God. The Meaning of Hotep traces the historical records that have left an indelible proof that before God was conceived of in his masculine forms that are known of in the worlds today, God was, primarily, a woman. The Meaning of Hotep presents evidence that the Ten Commandments existed long before Moses and the Psalms before David. This book is for anyone interested in learning about spirituality in general.","price":14.95,"pageCount":172,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781466965164-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}
{"isbn":9781523960408,"title":"Mentacide and Other Essay","author":["Mwalimu BOMANI BARUTI"],"publishedDate":"2016-02-17","description":"Mentacide occurs when you willingly think and act out of someone else's interpretation of reality to their benefit and against our survival. It is a state of subtle insanity which, over the last few hundred years, has come to characterize more and more Afrikans globally. This collection of essays addresses various aspects of this self-negating confusion. For we, as an Afrikan people, cannot possibly attain an independent, self-sustaining empowerment without a clear understanding of who we are and are not. We cannot be someone else and ourselves at the same time, especially when that someone else is hell-bent on destroying us. For that reason, these lectures look into this confusion by critiquing our refusal to accept responsibility for consciously rearing our children, the political treason of some of the intellectuals who still pretend to speak for us, the flight of our emotions from european faiths to Afrikan spiritual systems designed to cater to our unchanged european ways and the systematic incarceration of our men and women and boys and girls while, at the same time, bring solutions to the table by paying homage to the thought and behavior of revolutionary Ancestors and Elders, discussing the responsibilities that our daughters and sons must be taught the internalize in preparation for their adult duties and examining the mental and physical conditions that are essential to our independent empowerment as a people. As we know, problems and solutions work hand in hand without knowing something is wrong or if aware, why what is wrong is wrong, we cannot implement ideas or programs that will help us solve our problems to our advantage. To that end, this collection of essays is an Afrikan centered investigation into both some of our problems and potential solutions to these problems.","price":16.95,"pageCount":220,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781523960408-L.jpg"}

With so much attention on the flames,” she writes, “everyone had ignored the kindling.” Since 1865 and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, every time African Americans have made advances towards full participation in our democracy, white reaction has fueled a deliberate and relentless rollback of their gains. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Black Codes and Jim Crow; the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision was met with the shutting down of public schools throughout the South while taxpayer dollars financed segregated white private schools; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 triggered a coded but powerful response, the so-called Southern Strategy and the War on Drugs that disenfranchised millions of African Americans while propelling presidents Nixon and Reagan into the White House. Carefully linking these and other historical flashpoints when social progress for African Americans was countered by deliberate and cleverly crafted opposition, Anderson pulls back the veil that has long covered actions made in the name of protecting democracy, fiscal responsibility, or protection against fraud, rendering visible the long lineage of white rage. Compelling and dramatic in the unimpeachable history it relates, White Rage will add an important new dimension to the national conversation about race in America.","price":26,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781632864123-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

{"isbn":9781510729629,"title":"The Plot to Kill King","author":["William F. Pepper"],"publisher":"Skyhorse","publishedDate":"2018-01-16","description":"Bestselling author, James Earl Ray’s defense attorney, and, later, lawyer for the King family William Pepper reveals who actually killed MLK. William Pepper was James Earl Ray’s lawyer in the trial for the murder of Martin Luther King Jr., and even after Ray’s conviction and death, Pepper continues to adamantly argue Ray’s innocence. This myth-shattering exposé is a revised, updated, and heavily expanded volume of Pepper’s original bestselling and critically acclaimed book Orders to Kill, with twenty-six years of additional research included. The result reveals dramatic new details of the night of the murder, the trial, and why Ray was chosen to take the fall for an evil conspiracy—a government-sanctioned assassination of our nation’s greatest leader. The plan, according to Pepper, was for a team of United States Army Special Forces snipers to kill King, but just as they were taking aim, a backup civilian assassin pulled the trigger. In The Plot to Kill King, Pepper shares the evidence and testimonies that prove that Ray was a fall guy chosen by those who viewed King as a dangerous revolutionary. His findings make the book one of the most important of our time—the uncensored story of the murder of an American hero that contains disturbing revelations about the obscure inner-workings of our government and how it continues, even today, to obscure the truth.","price":19.99,"pageCount":772,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781510729629-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Do you know who you're meant to be? Do you know how to find the answers to questions like these? Knowledge of Self is the result of a process of self-discovery, but few of us know where to begin when we're ready to start looking deeper. Although self-actualization is the highest of all human needs, it is said that only 5% of people ever attain this goal. In the culture of the Nation of Gods and Earths, commonly known as the Five Percent, students are instructed that they must first learn themselves, then their worlds, and then what they must do in order to transform their world for the better. This often intense process has produced thousands of revolutionary thinkers in otherwise desperate environments, where poverty and hopelessness dominate. Until now, few mainstream publications have captured the brilliant yet practical perspectives of these luminary men and women. Knowledge of Self: A Collection of Writings on the Science of Everything in Life presents the thoughts of Five Percenters, both young and old, male and female, from all over the globe, in their own words. Through essays, poems, and even how-to articles, this anthology presents readers with an accurate portrait of what the Five Percent study and teach, as well as sound direction on how to answer timeless questions like: Who am I, and why am I here? Why is there so much injustice in the world, and what can be done about it? Who is God and where on Earth is he? How do I improve myself without losing myself? Why are people of color in the situations they're in? What can we do about the global problems of racism and poverty?","price":19.95,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780981617022-L.jpg","categories":["Education"]}

From there, Hamilton considers the real questions people frequently ask that continue to divide Christians and denominations alike, including: Were Adam and Eve real people? Why is God so violent in the Old Testament? Why would Paul command women to \"keep silent in the church\"? Is Jesus the only way to salvation? How does God view homosexual people? Is the Book of Revelation a guide to the End Times?

Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least get some streams on her mixtape. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died right before he hit big, Bri’s got massive shoes to fill. But when her mom unexpectedly loses her job, food banks and shut-off notices become as much a part of her life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it. On the Come Up is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are, and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working class black families. Brilliant, insightful, full of heart, this novel is another modern classic from one of the most influential literary voices of a generation.","price":18.99,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780062498564-L.jpg","categories":["Young Adult Fiction"]}

The author critically reviews the dynamics of the proverb, one verbal genre that embodies the high point of rhetoric in traditional and contemporary Africa, and explores in rich details the proverb's creative potential, authorship and effectiveness in crisis management. Yankah elevates the documentation of the African proverb beyond decontextualized compilations, and portrays the proverb as a dynamic communicative strategy in which form, meaning and logic are in constant flux. The study, which focuses on the Akan of Ghana, situates the proverb in the heart of real life discourse interactions and monitors its rhetorical efficacy on the basis of indigenous aesthetics. The book should be of value to folklorists, sociolinguists, anthropologists, literary scholars and students of African studies and communications.","price":29.95,"pageCount":296,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780966020120-L.jpg","categories":["Literary Criticism"]}

They experienced the worst kind of physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual abuse. Given such history, isn't it likely that many of the enslaved were severely traumatized? And did the trauma and the effects of such horrific abuse end with the abolition of slavery? Emancipation was followed by one hundred more years of institutionalized subjugation through the enactment of Black Codes and Jim Crow laws, peonage, convict leasing, domestic terrorism and lynching. Today the violations continue, and when combined with the crimes of the past, they result in yet unmeasured injury. What do repeated traumas, endured generation after generation by a people produce? What impact have these ordeals had on African Americans today? Dr. Joy DeGruy, answers these questions and more. With over thirty years of practical experience as a professional in the mental health field, Dr. DeGruy encourages African Americans to view their attitudes, assumptions, and behaviors through the lens of history and so gain a greater understanding of how centuries of slavery and oppression have impacted people of African descent in America. Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome helps to lay the necessary foundation to ensure the well-being and sustained health of future generations and provides a rare glimpse into the evolution of society's beliefs, feelings, attitudes and behavior concerning race in America.","price":19.95,"pageCount":241,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780985217273-L.jpg","categories":["African Americans"]}

Covering the full \"life cycle\" (including preconception, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, the senior years, and death), historian Daina Berry shows the lengths to which slaveholders would go to maximize profits. She draws from over ten years of research to explore how enslaved people responded to being appraised, bartered, and sold. By illuminating their lives, Berry ensures that the individuals she studies are regarded as people, not merely commodities. Analyzing the depth of this monetization of human property will change the way we think about slavery, reparations, capitalism, and nineteenth-century medical education\"--","price":27.95,"pageCount":262,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780807047620-L.jpg","categories":["SOCIAL SCIENCE"]}

Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status - much like their grandparents before them. In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community - and all of us - to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.","price":27.95,"pageCount":290,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781595581037-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Kendi"],"publisher":"One World/Ballantine","publishedDate":"2019","description":"From the National Book Award-winning author of Stamped from the Beginning comes a bracingly original approach to understanding and uprooting racism and inequality in our society--and in ourselves. \"The only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it--and then dismantle it.\" Ibram X. Kendi's concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America--but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi asks us to think about what an antiracist society might look like, and how we can play an active role in building it. In this book, Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science, bringing it all together with an engaging personal narrative of his own awakening to antiracism. How to Be an Antiracist is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond an awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a truly just and equitable society. Advance praise for How to Be an Antiracist \"This latest from the National Book Award-winning author is no guidebook to getting woke. . . . Rather, it is a combination of memoir and extension of . . . Kendi's towering Stamped From the Beginning that leads readers through a taxonomy of racist thought to anti-racist action. . . . Never wavering . . . Kendi methodically examines racism through numerous lenses: power, biology, ethnicity, body, culture, and so forth. . . . If Kendi is justifiably hard on America, he's just as hard on himself. . . . This unsparing honesty helps readers, both white and people of color, navigate this difficult intellectual territory. Not an easy read but an essential one.\"--Kirkus Reviews (starred review) \"Ibram Kendi is today's visionary in the enduring struggle for racial justice. In this personal and revelatory new work, he yet again holds up a transformative lens, challenging both mainstream and antiracist orthodoxy. He illuminates the foundations of racism in revolutionary new ways, and I am consistently challenged and inspired by his analysis. How to Be an Antiracist offers us a necessary and critical way forward.\"--Robin DiAngelo, New York Times bestselling author of White Fragility","price":27,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780525509288-L.jpg","categories":["HISTORY"]}

{"isbn":9780486452722,"title":"Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion","author":["Herbert Aptheker"],"publisher":"Courier Corporation","publishedDate":"1966","description":"In the summer of 1831, a band of some forty slaves led by Nat Turner attacked slave-owning residents of Southampton County, Virginia. One of the largest and most violent revolts in the history of the young nation, the rebellion took the lives of some sixty white men, women, and children. An outcry against the South's exploitative slave system, the revolt was suppressed within forty-eight hours, and Turner, who eluded authorities for months, was eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed. The impact of Turner's uprising was monumental. Abolitionists looked for ways to encourage and support future insurrections while white Southerners took revenge on both slave and free African-Americans. Nearly 200 blacks, many of whom had nothing to do with the rebellion, were beaten, tortured, and murdered by white mobs. Herbert Aptheker's account of the bloodiest slave uprising in U.S. history was the first full-length study of its kind. Meticulously researched, it explores the nature of Southern society in the early nineteenth century and the conditions that led to the rebellion. Described by the Journal of American History as \"a thorough and scholarly treatment,\" the text includes Turner's \"Confessions,\" recorded before his execution in 1831.","price":10.95,"pageCount":152,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780486452722-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

This requires that scholars, activists, pastors and leaders from all walks of life must create powerful, action-oriented voices that lead to the change we desire to see both in America and abroad. Dr Boyce Watkins is one of the leading voices in the diaspora and one of the most profound black thinkers in history. His audience reaches over 5 million people per week and he is one of the most thought-provoking and courageous commentators the world has ever seen. Building from two decades of teaching at the college level, Dr Watkins freely gives of his wisdom and expertise to the black community in ways that are shifting the definition of what it means to be a black scholar in America. In this book, Dr Watkins chronicles a series of essays which define his thinking as one of the engineers of the Great Economic Awakening that has taken place in the African American community over the last several years. He also speaks to various socio-political issues which reflect the realities of being black in America. Consistent and focused, Dr Watkins has written letters and articles to black America on a daily basis, holding nothing back in his passionate and structured plea for black intellectual strength, focus and spiritual sovereignty. In other words, he is always encouraging our people to THINK.","price":24.99,"pageCount":372,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781536805598-L.jpg"}

John Baines sustains that morality is a powerful tool for success in life. Morals for the 21st Century is not a simple reformulation of natural morals, but an absolutely new proposal of morals in which the author categorically asserts and presents experiments to the effect that morality is firmly set on scientific premises, for the first time breaking the ideological and theological bases which have always served as their support. The morals proposed by John Baines are situated in the world of the laws of energy, that is, in the strict domain of physics. Every person that complies with this moral code, will be complying with himself: by respecting this moral code, he will be respecting himself: sowing the laws of this moral code in the earth of his being, he will harvest multiplying each grain, proving the benefits of complying with this eternal order of things, without need of fear or faith. \"Genuine morals correspond to the harmonization guidelines of the Universe and Nature, so that those who carefully observe their laws will always be successful...\" Also available in Spanish, Arabic.","price":18.95,"pageCount":625,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781882692033-L.jpg","categories":["Philosophy"]}

While this waterway was a symbol of freedom and equality for thousands of enslaved black Americans who had escaped from the horrible institution of enslavement, the Ohio River was also used to transport thousands of slaves down the river to the Deep South. Due to Cincinnati's location on the banks of the river, the city's economy was tied to the slave society in the South. However, a special cadre of individuals became very active in the quest for freedom undertaken by African American fugitives on their journeys to the North. Thanks to spearheading by this group of Cincinnatian trailblazers, the \"Queen City\" became a primary destination on the Underground Railroad, the first multiethnic, multiracial, multiclass human-rights movement in the history of the United States.","price":21.99,"pageCount":127,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781467111560-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Central to such decisions, however, are the forces that determine what options show up on the agenda and what options do not even make it to the table. Imperial Brain Trust, published in 1977, is the classic study of the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization that has, for decades, played a central behind the scenes role is shaping such foreign policy choices. This private club and think tank, bringing together the New York establishment and the Washington foreign policy elite as well as other powerful forces, took the lead in laying out the plans for post-World II international order. The Council also traced the key guidelines for Cold War intervention and vetted and advised generations of White House officials. Rival think tanks, such as the far-right Heritage Foundation, now have a higher profile. But the Council on Foreign Relations continues to mark the boundaries of what insiders consider to be respectable foreign policy discussion, helping aspirants to policy influence test out their schemes for establishment approval. \" A thoroughly researched expose of the discreet workings of the powerful Council on Foreign Relations an influential oligarchy which not only studies but forms U.S. policy.

Islam's Black Slaves documents a centuries-old institution that still survives, and traces the business of slavery and its repercussions from Islam's inception in the seventh century, through its history in China, India, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Libya, and Spain, and on to Sudan and Mauritania, where, even today, slaves continue to be sold. Ronald Segal reveals for the first time the numbers involved in this trade--as many millions as were transported to the Americas--and explores the differences between the traffic in the East and the West. Islam's Black Slaves also examines the continued denial of the very existence of this sector of the black diaspora, although it survives today in significant numbers; and in an illuminating conclusion, Segal addresses the appeal of Islam to African-American communities, and the perplexing refusal of Black Muslim leaders to acknowledge black slavery and oppression in present-day Mauritania and Sudan. A fitting companion to Segal's previous work, Islam's Black Slaves is a fascinating account of an often unacknowledged tradition, and a riveting cross-cultural commentary.","price":21,"pageCount":273,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780374527976-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

It claims to present the most ancient and fundamental principles of Egyptian philosophy, pulled from the Hermetic lore of the god Djehuti himself. Its authors are unknown, its sources impossible to verify, and even its publication is cloaked in mystery. Yet the seven principles of The Kybalion are not only startlingly parallel to our most recent understandings of ancient Egyptian philosophy, they are also undeniable, meaningful and relevant to everyday life. The Kybalion repeatedly references how its seven principles (Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender) can be seen in the workings of modern science. Although this book was composed in 1908, these statements appear even more accurate today. The latest revelations from the world of scientific inquiry suggest that The Kybalion's seven laws may very well describe the nature of our visible Universe. If they do, indeed, describe the fundamental workings of our material world and nature, it follows that these same laws can be used to be better understand our own lives and the way things work around us.","price":14.95,"pageCount":132,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781935721253-L.jpg"}

Allen"],"publisher":"Verso","publishedDate":"2012-11-20","description":"Groundbreaking analysis of the birth of racism in America. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, Martin Luther King outlined a dream of an America where people would not be judged by the color of their skin. That dream has yet to be realized, but some three centuries ago it was a reality. Back then, neither social practice nor law recognized any special privileges in connection with being white. But by the early decades of the eighteenth century, that had all changed. Racial oppression became the norm in the plantation colonies, and African Americans suffered under its yoke for more than two hundred years. In Volume II of The Invention of the White Race, Theodore Allen explores the transformation that turned African bond-laborers into slaves and segregated them from their fellow proletarians of European origin. In response to labor unrest, where solidarities were not determined by skin color, the plantation bourgeoisie sought to construct a buffer of poor whites, whose new racial identity would protect them from the enslavement visited upon African Americans. This was the invention of the white race, an act of cruel ingenuity that haunts America to this day. Allen’s acclaimed study has become indispensable in debates on the origins of racial oppression in America. In this updated edition, scholar Jeffrey B. Perry provides a new introduction, a select bibliography and a study guide.","price":29.95,"pageCount":422,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781844677702-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Opening with a letter from James Baldwin to Angela, and including contributions from numerous radicals and commentators such as Black Panthers George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale and Erica Huggins, this book is not only an account of Davis's incarceration and the struggles surrounding it, but also perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough analysis of the prison system of the United States and the figure embodied in Davis's arrest and imprisonment--the political prisoner. Since the book was written, the carceral system in the US has grown from strength to strength, with more of its black population behind bars than ever before. The scathing analysis of the role of prison and the policing of black populations offered by Davis and her comrades in this astonishing volume remains as relevant today as the day it was published.","price":17.95,"pageCount":272,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781784787691-L.jpg"}

{"isbn":9781463507503,"title":"The How to Eat to Live Holistic Companion","author":["Nasir Hakim","Rose Hakim"],"publisher":"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","publishedDate":"2011-05-27","description":"How To Eat To Live, Books 1 & 2, were first published in 1967 and 1972 respectively. In these books Elijah Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, pointed out very clearly and decisively that it all is from Allah (God) in person. He believes he met God in the form of a man and it is He who revealed the BEST knowledge of how to eat to live. We make no attempt at reinterpreting, reinventing or improving upon what the Messenger received from God. The objective of this book is only to make the reader aware of the means and ways the food and their by-products have been adversely transformed from the initial published dates of these writings to date, and from this awareness and updated information contained herein, can stay consistent with the principles taught in these writings.We felt there was a great need for an essential companion; essential, because through processing and commercialization, food has taken on a different form from what we had grown accustomed to. Since the 60's and 70's, food that was once called “pure” is not pure. Various government agencies responsible for checking the safety of food have adopted various definitions for political and economic reasons, but at the expense of health. Consequently, the word pure simply means that there are “acceptable” levels of toxins, or acceptable levels of mercury, or acceptable levels of pesticides, herbicides or solvents per part, per million.There was a time when brown sugar was a lot healthier than sugar is today. What was once stated as brown sugar was simply “raw sugar.” It was a lot healthier and when Elijah Muhammad recommended it, he did not mean what today has come to be known as brown sugar, which is highly refined white sugar with molasses poured over it. For on one hand he would not advise us to NOT eat refined products while simultaneously telling us to eat the new form of brown sugar.As well, take for instance the aspect of pork. This so-called food is completely prohibited due to forbidding of God and the indestructible worm inside. It is never to be taken for food, so much so, Elijah Muhammad advises that we should die first before we eat it. In today's market, there are hundreds of thousands of products that are made from pork and its by-products. Since the 60's, these products are not so well pointed out. These are just a few of the reasons this book is essential and will serve as an excellent companion to How To Eat To Live, Books 1 & 2.There are two main veins this book will pursue: one is the processes of food and the surrounding equipment associated and secondly, the commercialization of it for maximum profits and the expense of the people's health in general.

Founded at a time when liberal arts education was widely seen as either futile, dangerous, or impractical for blacks, especially women, DST is, in Giddings's words, a \"compelling reflection of block women's aspirations for themselves and for society.\" Giddings notes that unlike other organizations with racial goals, Delta Sigma Theta was created to change and benefit individuals rather than society. As a sorority, it was formed to bring women together as sisters, but at the some time to address the divisive, often class-related issues confronting black women in our society. There is, in Giddings's eyes, a tension between these goals that makes Delta Sigma Theta a fascinating microcosm of the struggles of black women and their organizations. DST members have included Mary McLeod Bethune, Mary Church Terrell, Margaret Murray Washington, Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, and, on the cultural side, Leontyne Price, Lena Horne, Ruby Dee, Judith Jamison, and Roberta Flack. In Search of Sisterhood is full of compelling, fascinating anecdotes told by the Deltas themselves, and illustrated with rare early photographs of the Delta women.","price":15.99,"pageCount":336,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780688135096-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

L. Hughley confronts and remixes white people’s “advice” in this “satirical but apt addition to the culture’s fraught conversation about race” (New York Times Book Review) In America, a black man is three times more likely to be killed in encounters with police than a white guy. If only he had complied with the cop, he might be alive today, pundits say in the aftermath of the latest shooting of an unarmed black man. Or, Maybe he shouldn’t have worn that hoodie … or, moved more slowly … not been out so late … Wait, why are black people allowed to drive, anyway? This isn’t a new phenomenon. White people have been giving “advice” to black folks for as long as anyone can remember, telling them how to pick cotton, where to sit on a bus, what neighborhood to live in, when they can vote, and how to wear our pants. Despite centuries of whites’ advice, it seems black people still aren’t listening, and the results are tragic. Now, at last, activist, comedian, and New York Times bestselling author D. L. Hughley offers How Not to Get Shot, an illustrated how-to guide for black people, full of insight from white people, translated by one of the funniest black dudes on the planet. In these pages you will learn how to act, dress, speak, walk, and drive in the safest manner possible. You also will finally understand the white mind. It is a book that can save lives. Or at least laugh through the pain. Black people: Are you ready to not get shot! White people: Do you want to learn how to help the cause?

Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been. In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free. A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.","price":26,"pageCount":256,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781501125652-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

Today, we, and our children, are subject to gangsterized and criminalized images of African people in America in the attempt to justify our extermination. Sophisticated mass media manipulation places these images in broad circulation. Miseducation in many public schools aids this process with textbooks that are woefully insufficient and teachers who lack cultural competence. This book marks the beginning of a highly anticipated series to increase our cultural competence by one of our great Master Teachers. Professor Kaba Kamene is a trusted Elder, a Seba (Master Teacher) who opens the door to the Universe so that his students may shine like a star\" (Obenga). His work as an African-centered educator with over 30 years of public school teaching experience, scholar and professor of Black Studies, represents the continuation of a powerful priestly Kemetic cultural tradition that is essentially African. Professor Kamene has a track record of producing excellence in some of the most challenging urban schools and the rare distinction of demonstrating this excellence in working with students from Pre-K to post-doctorate. He is a living library who has apprenticed under sacred African Master Teachers like Dr. John Henrik Clarke and Dr. Asa Hilliard. The Maafa is the catastrophic interruption of African sovereignty and civilization. It includes far more than \"slavery\" and lynching and it is still going on. To emerge in the midst of our captivity with any semblance of African consciousness is nothing short of a miracle, given the fact that the best minds of Europe and America have been put to the task of ensuring that our culture and consciousness be obliterated. This book is a literary libation that elevates and celebrates the life and legacy of William Leo Hansberry, the Father of Black Studies. He had the character, consciousness and commitment to \"rescue and reconstruct our history and put it back into the hands of those who created it\" (Karenga, 1984). Professor Hansberry, along with Professor Kaba Kamene, constitute a small cadre of keepers of the culture who have labored in the face of continuous high-tech attempts to erase our culture. This book is a gift and a treasure. Like the ones that will follow it in this series it is a critical piece in the puzzle for our cultural reconstruction and identity restoration. As my grandmother used to instruct me and my siblings growing up, \"read and be wise.\" Chike Akua, Teacher Transformation Institute Author of Education for Transformation: The Keys to Releasing the Genius of African American Students Please confirm that you have received this and that is sufficient.

The Ethiopian Jews and the Lemba Jews have been recognized by modern Jewry as having a connection to Ancient Israel but other African countries are often overlooked. Why is this? Jews today now boast to have \"Israelite\" heritage based on the \"Cohen Model Haplogroup\" genetic marker that they say links them to the High Priest Cohenite clan of Aaron, the brother of Moses. But what exactly is this \"Cohen Model Haplogroup\"? Who else in the world has it and is it really an \"Israelite Genetic Marker\" as they claim? In the Book, \"Hebrews to Negroes 2: Volume 2, I dive in deep into the \"world of genetics\" to debunk the lies that has been spread about who we call \"Jews\" or the \"Chosen People\" today. Using Linguistics, Ancient written records from Arab historians, Craniometry, Tooth records, Ancient maps, Ancient archaeological relics, Ancient pictures, the Bible, Genetics and \"Critical Thinking\" one can find out the TRUTH about who the REAL ISRAELITES of the Bible are. It will tell us where we should be looking in regards to finding the \"authentic\" scattered \"Children of Israel,\" not \"outsiders\" who have invaded Judea for the last 2,000 years and decided to convert to Judaism. In this Book many clues to our \"many\" questions about the Bible will be answered and explored. Such as: Who are the descendants of the Ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Cushites and Phuttites today? Who are the \"Original Arabs\" and where are they at today? What is the connection between the Lemba Jews, African-Americans, Caribbean Blacks, Afro-Latinos and \"Bantus\" West/East Africans?

Who were the Jews that were exiled from Spain and Portugal in 1492 A.D.' Were they \"Black Jews\" or \"White Jews\"? Who are the Sephardic Jews and are they \"imposters\" as well? Who were the Moors?

Prior to that time, most of the Eastern energy practices transmitted to the West were incomplete, dealing only with the ascending yang/masculine channel, which shoots life-force energy up the spine. The Microcosmic Orbit showed practitioners how to establish the descending yin/feminine channel of the life-force energy loop. Within Taoist systems, cultivating feminine energy has always been seen as the key to gaining balance and wholeness. Healing Light of the Tao presents the more advanced methods of chi cultivation in the Microcosmic Orbit, offering a full understanding of Taoist spiritual theory through its comprehensive overview of the complete Taoist body/mind/spirit system. The book also includes more advanced meditation methods for absorbing the higher frequencies of Earth Force, Cosmic Force, and Universal Force (Heavenly chi) into the basic orbit. It establishes a spiritual science that not only emphasizes practical benefits to health, sexual vitality, and emotional balance, but also shows how changes made in the energy body can lead to physical rejuvenation that the Taoists called immortality.","price":26.95,"pageCount":608,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781594771132-L.jpg","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"]}

Curry’s provocative book The Man-Not is a justification for Black Male Studies. He posits that we should conceptualize the Black male as a victim, oppressed by his sex. The Man-Not, therefore,is a corrective of sorts, offering a concept of Black males that could challenge the existing accounts of Black men and boys desiring the power of white men who oppress them that has been proliferated throughout academic research across disciplines. Curry argues that Black men struggle with death and suicide, as well as abuse and rape, and their genred existence deserves study and theorization. This book offers intellectual, historical, sociological, and psychological evidence that the analysis of patriarchy offered by mainstream feminism (including Black feminism) does not yet fully understand the role that homoeroticism, sexual violence, and vulnerability play in the deaths and lives of Black males. Curry challenges how we think of and perceive the conditions that actually affect all Black males.","price":34.95,"pageCount":286,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781439914861-L.jpg","categories":["Social Science"]}

Niall Ferguson's House of Rothschild: Money's Prophets 1798-1848 was hailed as a \"great biography\" by Time magazine and named one of the best books of the year by Business Week. Now, with all the depth, clarity and drama with which he traced their ascent, Ferguson - the first historian with access to the long-lost Rothschild family archives - concludes his myth-breaking portrait of once of the most fascinating and power families of all time. From Crimea to World War II, wars repeatedly threatened the stability of the Rothschilds' worldwide empire. Despite these many global upheavals, theirs remained the biggest bank in the world up until the First World War, their interests extending far beyond the realm of finance. Yet the Rothschilds' failure to establish themselves successfully in the United States proved fateful, and as financial power shifted from London to New York after 1914, their power waned. \"A stupendous achievement, a triumph of historical research and imagination.\"—Robert Skidelsky, The New York Review of Books \"Niall Ferguson's brilliant and altogether enthralling two-volume family saga proves that academic historians can still tell great stories that the rest of us want to read.\"—The New York Times Book Review \"Superb ...

A story filled with towering historical figures, The History of White People closes a huge gap in literature that has long focused on the non-white and forcefully reminds us that the concept of “race” is an all-too-human invention whose meaning, importance, and reality have changed as it has been driven by a long and rich history of events.","price":18.95,"pageCount":512,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780393339741-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

{"isbn":9781568585987,"title":"Stamped from the Beginning","author":["Ibram X. Kendi"],"publisher":"Nation Books","publishedDate":"2017-08-15","description":"Some Americans cling desperately to the myth that we are living in a post-racial society, that the election of the first black president spelled the doom of racism. In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading pro-slavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America. Contrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.","price":19.99,"pageCount":592,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781568585987-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

One month before the release of the highly anticipated film The Birth of a Nation, actress Gabrielle Union shook the world with a vulnerable and impassioned editorial in which she urged our society to have compassion for victims of sexual violence. In the wake of rape allegations made against director and actor Nate Parker, Union—a forty-four-year-old actress who launched her career with roles in iconic ’90s movies—instantly became the insightful, outspoken actress that Hollywood has been desperately awaiting. With honesty and heartbreaking wisdom, she revealed her own trauma as a victim of sexual assault: \"It is for you that I am speaking. This is real. We are real.\" In this moving collection of thought provoking essays infused with her unique wisdom and deep humor, Union uses that same fearlessness to tell astonishingly personal and true stories about power, color, gender, feminism, and fame. Union tackles a range of experiences, including bullying, beauty standards, and competition between women in Hollywood, growing up in white California suburbia and then spending summers with her black relatives in Nebraska, coping with crushes, puberty, and the divorce of her parents. Genuine and perceptive, Union bravely lays herself bare, uncovering a complex and courageous life of self-doubt and self-discovery with incredible poise and brutal honesty. Throughout, she compels us to be ethical and empathetic, and reminds us of the importance of confidence, self-awareness, and the power of sharing truth, laughter, and support.","price":16.99,"pageCount":272,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780062693990-L.jpg","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"]}

The Sonnenburgs argue that the microbiota determines in no small part whether we're sick or healthy, fit or obese, sunny or moody--and that the microbiota has always been with us, coevolving with humans and entwining its functions with ours. They show us that humans are really composite organisms with microbial and human parts. But now, because of changes to diet, antibiotic over-use, and over-sterilization, our gut microbiota is facing a \"mass extinction event,\" which may explain the mysterious spike in some of our most troubling modern afflictions, from food allergies to autism, cancer to depression. It doesn't have to be this way. The Good Gut is a groundbreaking work that offers a new plan for health that focuses on how to nourish your microbiota, including recipes and a menu plan. The Sonnenburgs show how we can keep our microbiota off the endangered species list and strengthen the community that inhabits our gut and thereby improve our own health. In this important and timely investigation, they look at safe alternatives to antibiotics; dietary and lifestyle choices to encourage microbial health; the management of the aging microbΙ and the nourishment of your own individual microbiome. Caring for our gut microbes may be the most important health choice we can make.","price":18,"pageCount":320,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780143108085-L.jpg","categories":["Health & Fitness"]}

By now, we all know that America is hostile to Black men. But that is precisely the problem. Too much familiarity breeds disrespect. We have become so familiar with the fact of the American assault on the Black male that we don't respect that fact like we should. This is why there is no real urgency to change the situation in the lives of individuals. We have the problem of simultaneously knowing both too well and too insufficiently. Black men know well that there is an assault but we don't know ell enough about the plot to guard against falling prey to its many traps on a daily basis and Black women know their man is under assault but don't yet know enough of the architecture of the plot to keep from unwittingly becoming an aider and abettor to the plot, as he is an aider and abettor in the plot himself. One of the reasons most people, Black and white, fail to grasp and take seriously the depth of the problem of this assault on the Black male is because we assume it be an isolated historical American phenomenon restricted to antebellum America. And we believe that the feminization of the Black male is incidental to the white man's strategy of domination--a side show, so to speak. It is not. It is in fact central to his strategy. The American assault on the Black man--his manhood and his masculinity--from slavery till today was and is part of a Global Project, and only by understanding the Global Project and its methods repeated all over the world, can we fully appreciate what is going here in America.\"--Back cover.","price":19.95,"pageCount":414,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780998799407-L.jpg","categories":["African American men"]}

In this sweeping collection of new and selected essays, Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America's \"first white president.\" But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period--and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation's old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective--the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president. We Were Eight Years in Power features Coates's iconic essays first published in The Atlantic, including \"Fear of a Black President,\" \"The Case for Reparations,\" and \"The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration,\" along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates's own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era. We Were Eight Years in Power is a vital account of modern America, from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment. *Kirkus Reviews (starred review) Praise for We Were Eight Years in Power \"Essential . . . Coates's probing essays about race, politics, and history became necessary ballast for this nation's gravity-defying moment.\" --The Boston Globe \"Coates's always sharp commentary is particularly insightful as each day brings a new upset to the cultural and political landscape laid during the term of the nation's first black president. . . . Coates is a crucial voice in the public discussion of race and equality, and readers will be eager for his take on where we stand now and why.\" --Booklist (starred review)","price":28,"pageCount":367,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780399590566-L.jpg","categories":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY"]}

May We Forever Stand tells an essential part of that story. With lyrics penned by James Weldon Johnson and music composed by his brother Rosamond, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" was embraced almost immediately as an anthem that captured the story and the aspirations of black Americans. Since the song's creation, it has been adopted by the NAACP and performed by countless artists in times of both crisis and celebration, cementing its place in African American life up through the present day. In this rich, poignant, and readable work, Imani Perry tells the story of the Black National Anthem as it traveled from South to North, from civil rights to black power, and from countless family reunions to Carnegie Hall and the Oval Office. Drawing on a wide array of sources, Perry uses \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" as a window on the powerful ways African Americans have used music and culture to organize, mourn, challenge, and celebrate for more than a century.","price":26,"pageCount":296,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781469638607-L.jpg","categories":["History"]}

Until the present, the only English translation of his Hindu love classic was that of the famous English explorer Sir Richard Burton, published in 1883. Unlike Burton's version, Alain Daniélou's new translation preserves the numbered verse divisions of the original and includes two essential commentaries: the Fayamangala commentary, written in Sanskrit by Yashodhara during the Middle Ages, and a modern Hindi commentary by Devadatta Shastri. Whereas Burton's Victorian reluctance to translate certain terms obscured our understanding of the philosophy and techniques of the Kama Sutra, Daniélou has preserved the full explicitness of the original, dealing with everything from the art of scratching to relations with the wives of others. Realistic and pragmatic in its approach, the Kama Sutra deals without ambiguity or hypocrisy with all aspects of sexual life--including marriage, adultery, prostitution, group sex, sadomasochism, male and female homosexuality, and transvestism. The text paints a fascinating portrait of an India whose openness to sexuality gave rise to a highly developed expression of the erotic.","price":19.95,"pageCount":576,"image":"http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780892815258-L.jpg","categories":["Self-Help"]}
